                    <l>Of Man’s first disobedience, and the fruit</l>
                    <l>Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste</l>
                    <l>Brought death into the World, and all our woe,</l>
                    <l>With loss of Eden, till one greater Man</l>
                    <l>Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,</l>
                    <l>Sing, Heavenly Muse, that, on the secret top</l>
                    <l>Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire</l>
                    <l>That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed</l>
                    <l>In the beginning how the heavens and earth</l>
                    <l>Rose out of Chaos: or, if Sion hill</l>

                    <l>Fast by the oracle of God, I thence</l>
                    <l>Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song,</l>
                    <l>That with no middle flight intends to soar</l>
                    <l>Above th’ Aonian mount, while it pursues</l>
                    <l>Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.</l>
                    <l>And chiefly thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer</l>
                    <l>Before all temples th’ upright heart and pure,</l>
                    <l>Instruct me, for thou know’st; thou from the first</l>
                    <l>Wast present, and, with mighty wings outspread,</l>
                    <l>Dove-like sat’st brooding on the vast Abyss,</l>
                    <l>And mad’st it pregnant: what in me is dark</l>
                    <l>Illumine, what is low raise and support;</l>
                    <l>That, to the height of this great argument,</l>
                    <l>I may assert Eternal Providence,</l>

                    <l>Moved our grand parents, in that happy state,</l>
                    <l>Favoured of Heaven so highly, to fall off</l>
                    <l>From their Creator, and transgress his will</l>
                    <l>For one restraint, lords of the World besides.</l>
                    <l>Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?</l>
                </lg>
            </p>
            <p>
                <lg>
                    <l>Th’ infernal Serpent; he it was whose guile,</l>
                    <l>Stirred up with envy and revenge, deceived</l>
                    <l>The mother of mankind, what time his pride</l>
                    <l>Had cast him out from Heaven, with all his host</l>
                    <l>Of rebel Angels, by whose aid, aspiring</l>
                    <l>To set himself in glory above his peers,</l>
                    <l>He trusted to have equalled the Most High,</l>
                    <l>If he opposed, and with ambitious aim</l>
                    <l>Against the throne and monarchy of God,</l>
                    <l>Raised impious war in Heaven and battle proud,</l>
                    <l>With vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power</l>
                    <l>Hurled headlong flaming from th’ ethereal sky,</l>
                    <l>With hideous ruin and combustion, down</l>
                    <l>To bottomless perdition, there to dwell</l>
                    <l>In adamantine chains and penal fire,</l>
                    <l>Who durst defy th’ Omnipotent to arms.</l>

                    <l>Nine times the space that measures day and night</l>
                    <l>To mortal men, he, with his horrid crew,</l>
                    <l>Lay vanquished, rolling in the fiery gulf,</l>
                    <l>Confounded, though immortal. But his doom</l>
                    <l>Reserved him to more wrath; for now the thought</l>
                    <l>Both of lost happiness and lasting pain</l>
                    <l>Torments him: round he throws his baleful eyes,</l>
                    <l>That witnessed huge affliction and dismay,</l>
                    <l>Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate.</l>
                    <l>At once, as far as Angels ken, he views</l>
                    <l>The dismal situation waste and wild.</l>
                    <l>A dungeon horrible, on all sides round,</l>
                    <l>As one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames</l>
                    <l>No light; but rather darkness visible</l>
                    <l>Served only to discover sights of woe,</l>
                    <l>Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace</l>
                    <l>And rest can never dwell, hope never comes</l>
                    <l>That comes to all, but torture without end</l>
                    <l>Still urges, and a fiery deluge, fed</l>
                    <l>With ever-burning sulphur unconsumed.</l>
                    <l>Such place Eternal Justice has prepared</l>
                    <l>For those rebellious; here their prison ordained</l>
                    <l>In utter darkness, and their portion set,</l>
                    <l>As far removed from God and light of Heaven</l>
                    <l>As from the centre thrice to th’ utmost pole.</l>
                    <l>Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell!</l>
                    <l>There the companions of his fall, o’erwhelmed</l>
                    <l>With floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,</l>
                    <l>He soon discerns; and, weltering by his side,</l>
                    <l>One next himself in power, and next in crime,</l>
                    <l>Long after known in Palestine, and named</l>
                    <l>Beelzebub. To whom th’ Arch-Enemy,</l>
                    <l>And thence in Heaven called Satan, with bold words</l>
                    <l>Breaking the horrid silence, thus began:—</l>
                </lg>
            </p>
            <p>
                <lg>
                    <l>“If thou beest he—but O how fallen! how changed</l>
                    <l>From him who, in the happy realms of light</l>
                    <l>Clothed with transcendent brightness, didst outshine</l>
                    <l>Myriads, though bright!—if he whom mutual league,</l>
                    <l>United thoughts and counsels, equal hope</l>
                    <l>And hazard in the glorious enterprise</l>
                    <l>Joined with me once, now misery hath joined</l>
                    <l>In equal ruin; into what pit thou seest</l>
                    <l>From what height fallen: so much the stronger proved</l>
                    <l>He with his thunder; and till then who knew</l>
                    <l>The force of those dire arms? Yet not for those,</l>
                    <l>Nor what the potent Victor in his rage</l>
                    <l>Can else inflict, do I repent, or change,</l>
                    <l>Though changed in outward lustre, that fixed mind,</l>
                    <l>And high disdain from sense of injured merit,</l>
                    <l>That with the Mightiest raised me to contend,</l>
                    <l>And to the fierce contentions brought along</l>
                    <l>Innumerable force of Spirits armed,</l>
                    <l>That durst dislike his reign, and, me preferring,</l>
                    <l>His utmost power with adverse power opposed</l>
                    <l>In dubious battle on the plains of Heaven,</l>
                    <l>And shook his throne. What though the field be lost?</l>
                    <l>All is not lost—the unconquerable will,</l>
                    <l>And study of revenge, immortal hate,</l>
                    <l>And courage never to submit or yield:</l>
                    <l>And what is else not to be overcome?</l>
                    <l>That glory never shall his wrath or might</l>
                    <l>Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace</l>
                    <l>With suppliant knee, and deify his power</l>
                    <l>Who, from the terror of this arm, so late</l>
                    <l>Doubted his empire—that were low indeed;</l>
                    <l>That were an ignominy and shame beneath</l>
                    <l>This downfall; since, by fate, the strength of Gods,</l>
                    <l>And this empyreal substance, cannot fail;</l>
                    <l>Since, through experience of this great event,</l>
                    <l>In arms not worse, in foresight much advanced,</l>
                    <l>We may with more successful hope resolve</l>
                    <l>To wage by force or guile eternal war,</l>
                    <l>Irreconcilable to our grand Foe,</l>
                    <l>Who now triumphs, and in th’ excess of joy</l>
                    <l>Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven.”</l>

            <p>
                <lg>
                    <l>So spake th’ apostate Angel, though in pain,</l>
                    <l>Vaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair;</l>
                    <l>And him thus answered soon his bold compeer:—</l>

                    <l>“O Prince, O Chief of many throned Powers</l>
                    <l>That led th’ embattled Seraphim to war</l>
                    <l>Under thy conduct, and, in dreadful deeds</l>
                    <l>Fearless, endangered Heaven’s perpetual King,</l>
                    <l>And put to proof his high supremacy,</l>
                    <l>Whether upheld by strength, or chance, or fate,</l>
                    <l>Too well I see and rue the dire event</l>
                    <l>That, with sad overthrow and foul defeat,</l>
                    <l>Hath lost us Heaven, and all this mighty host</l>
                    <l>In horrible destruction laid thus low,</l>
                    <l>As far as Gods and heavenly Essences</l>
                    <l>Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains</l>
                    <l>Invincible, and vigour soon returns,</l>
                    <l>Though all our glory extinct, and happy state</l>
                    <l>Here swallowed up in endless misery.</l>
                    <l>But what if he our Conqueror (whom I now</l>
                    <l>Of force believe almighty, since no less</l>
                    <l>Than such could have o’erpowered such force as ours)</l>
                    <l>Have left us this our spirit and strength entire,</l>

                    <l>Here in the heart of Hell to work in fire,</l>
                    <l>Or do his errands in the gloomy Deep?</l>
                    <l>What can it then avail though yet we feel</l>
                    <l>Strength undiminished, or eternal being</l>
                    <l>To undergo eternal punishment?”</l>

                    <l>Whereto with speedy words th’ Arch-Fiend replied:—</l>

                    <l>Doing or suffering: but of this be sure—</l>
                    <l>To do aught good never will be our task,</l>
                    <l>But ever to do ill our sole delight,</l>
                    <l>As being the contrary to his high will</l>
                    <l>Whom we resist. If then his providence</l>
                    <l>Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,</l>
                    <l>Our labour must be to pervert that end,</l>
                    <l>And out of good still to find means of evil;</l>
                    <l>Which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps</l>
                    <l>Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb</l>
                    <l>His inmost counsels from their destined aim.</l>
                    <l>But see! the angry Victor hath recalled</l>
                    <l>His ministers of vengeance and pursuit</l>
                    <l>Back to the gates of Heaven: the sulphurous hail,</l>
                    <l>Shot after us in storm, o’erblown hath laid</l>
                    <l>The fiery surge that from the precipice</l>
                    <l>Of Heaven received us falling; and the thunder,</l>
                    <l>Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage,</l>
                    <l>Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now</l>
                    <l>To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.</l>
                    <l>Let us not slip th’ occasion, whether scorn</l>
                    <l>Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.</l>
                    <l>Seest thou yon dreary plain, forlorn and wild,</l>
                    <l>The seat of desolation, void of light,</l>
                    <l>Save what the glimmering of these livid flames</l>
                    <l>Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend</l>
                    <l>From off the tossing of these fiery waves;</l>

                    <l>Our enemy, our own loss how repair,</l>
                    <l>How overcome this dire calamity,</l>
                    <l>What reinforcement we may gain from hope,</l>

                    <l>Thus Satan, talking to his nearest mate,</l>
                    <l>With head uplift above the wave, and eyes</l>
                    <l>That sparkling blazed; his other parts besides</l>
                    <l>Prone on the flood, extended long and large,</l>
                    <l>Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge</l>
                    <l>As whom the fables name of monstrous size,</l>
                    <l>Titanian or Earth-born, that warred on Jove,</l>
                    <l>Briareos or Typhon, whom the den</l>
                    <l>By ancient Tarsus held, or that sea-beast</l>
                    <l>Leviathan, which God of all his works</l>
                    <l>Created hugest that swim th’ ocean-stream.</l>
                    <l>Him, haply slumbering on the Norway foam,</l>
                    <l>The pilot of some small night-foundered skiff,</l>
                    <l>Deeming some island, oft, as seamen tell,</l>
                    <l>With fixed anchor in his scaly rind,</l>
                    <l>Moors by his side under the lee, while night</l>
                    <l>Invests the sea, and wished morn delays.</l>
                    <l>So stretched out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay,</l>
                    <l>Chained on the burning lake; nor ever thence</l>
                    <l>Had risen, or heaved his head, but that the will</l>
                    <l>And high permission of all-ruling Heaven</l>
                    <l>Left him at large to his own dark designs,</l>
                    <l>That with reiterated crimes he might</l>
                    <l>Heap on himself damnation, while he sought</l>
                    <l>Evil to others, and enraged might see</l>
                    <l>How all his malice served but to bring forth</l>
                    <l>Infinite goodness, grace, and mercy, shewn</l>
                    <l>On Man by him seduced, but on himself</l>
                    <l>Treble confusion, wrath, and vengeance poured.</l>

                    <l>Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool</l>
                    <l>His mighty stature; on each hand the flames</l>
                    <l>Driven backward slope their pointing spires, and rolled</l>
                    <l>In billows, leave i’ th’ midst a horrid vale.</l>
                    <l>Then with expanded wings he steers his flight</l>
                    <l>Aloft, incumbent on the dusky air,</l>
                    <l>That felt unusual weight; till on dry land</l>
                    <l>He lights—if it were land that ever burned</l>
                    <l>With solid, as the lake with liquid fire,</l>
                    <l>And such appeared in hue as when the force</l>
                    <l>Of subterranean wind transports a hill</l>
                    <l>Torn from Pelorus, or the shattered side</l>
                    <l>Of thundering Etna, whose combustible</l>
                    <l>And fuelled entrails, thence conceiving fire,</l>
                    <l>Sublimed with mineral fury, aid the winds,</l>
                    <l>And leave a singed bottom all involved</l>
                    <l>With stench and smoke. Such resting found the sole</l>
                    <l>Of unblest feet. Him followed his next mate;</l>
                    <l>Both glorying to have scaped the Stygian flood</l>
                    <l>As gods, and by their own recovered strength,</l>

                    <l>Whom reason hath equalled, force hath made supreme</l>

                    <l>Here we may reign secure; and, in my choice,</l>

                    <l>Ethereal temper, massy, large, and round,</l>
                    <l>Behind him cast. The broad circumference</l>
                    <l>Hung on his shoulders like the moon, whose orb</l>
                    <l>Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views</l>
                    <l>At evening, from the top of Fesole,</l>

                    <l>His legions—Angel Forms, who lay entranced</l>
                    <l>Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks</l>
                    <l>In Vallombrosa, where th’ Etrurian shades</l>

                    <l>And broken chariot-wheels. So thick bestrown,</l>
                    <l>Abject and lost, lay these, covering the flood,</l>
                    <l>Under amazement of their hideous change.</l>
                    <l>He called so loud that all the hollow deep</l>

                    <l>Th’ advantage, and, descending, tread us down</l>
                    <l>Thus drooping, or with linked thunderbolts</l>

                    <l>Of human sacrifice, and parents’ tears;</l>
                    <l>Though, for the noise of drums and timbrels loud,</l>
                    <l>Their children’s cries unheard that passed through fire</l>
                    <l>To his grim idol. Him the Ammonite</l>
                    <l>Worshiped in Rabba and her watery plain,</l>
                    <l>In Argob and in Basan, to the stream</l>
                    <l>Of utmost Arnon. Nor content with such</l>
                    <l>Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart</l>
                    <l>Of Solomon he led by fraud to build</l>
                    <l>His temple right against the temple of God</l>
                    <l>On that opprobrious hill, and made his grove</l>
                    <l>The pleasant valley of Hinnom, Tophet thence</l>
                    <l>And black Gehenna called, the type of Hell.</l>
                    <l>Next Chemos, th’ obscene dread of Moab’s sons,</l>
                    <l>From Aroar to Nebo and the wild</l>
                    <l>Of southmost Abarim; in Hesebon</l>
                    <l>And Horonaim, Seon’s real, beyond</l>
                    <l>The flowery dale of Sibma clad with vines,</l>
                    <l>And Eleale to th’ Asphaltic Pool:</l>
                    <l>Peor his other name, when he enticed</l>
                    <l>Israel in Sittim, on their march from Nile,</l>
                    <l>To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.</l>
                    <l>Yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged</l>
                    <l>Even to that hill of scandal, by the grove</l>
                    <l>Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate,</l>
                    <l>Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell.</l>
                    <l>With these came they who, from the bordering flood</l>
                    <l>Of old Euphrates to the brook that parts</l>
                    <l>Egypt from Syrian ground, had general names</l>
                    <l>Of Baalim and Ashtaroth—those male,</l>
                    <l>These feminine. For Spirits, when they please,</l>
                    <l>Can either sex assume, or both; so soft</l>
                    <l>And uncompounded is their essence pure,</l>
                    <l>Not tried or manacled with joint or limb,</l>
                    <l>Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,</l>
                    <l>Like cumbrous flesh; but, in what shape they choose,</l>
                    <l>Dilated or condensed, bright or obscure,</l>
                    <l>Can execute their airy purposes,</l>
                    <l>And works of love or enmity fulfil.</l>
                    <l>For those the race of Israel oft forsook</l>
                    <l>Their Living Strength, and unfrequented left</l>
                    <l>His righteous altar, bowing lowly down</l>
                    <l>To bestial gods; for which their heads as low</l>
                    <l>Bowed down in battle, sunk before the spear</l>
                    <l>Of despicable foes. With these in troop</l>
                    <l>Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians called</l>
                    <l>Astarte, queen of heaven, with crescent horns;</l>
                    <l>To whose bright image nightly by the moon</l>
                    <l>Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs;</l>
                    <l>In Sion also not unsung, where stood</l>
                    <l>Her temple on th’ offensive mountain, built</l>
                    <l>By that uxorious king whose heart, though large,</l>
                    <l>Beguiled by fair idolatresses, fell</l>
                    <l>To idols foul. Thammuz came next behind,</l>
                    <l>Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured</l>
                    <l>The Syrian damsels to lament his fate</l>
                    <l>In amorous ditties all a summer’s day,</l>
                    <l>While smooth Adonis from his native rock</l>
                    <l>Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood</l>
                    <l>Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the love-tale</l>
                    <l>Infected Sion’s daughters with like heat,</l>
                    <l>Whose wanton passions in the sacred porch</l>
                    <l>Ezekiel saw, when, by the vision led,</l>
                    <l>His eye surveyed the dark idolatries</l>
                    <l>Of alienated Judah. Next came one</l>
                    <l>Who mourned in earnest, when the captive ark</l>
                    <l>Maimed his brute image, head and hands lopt off,</l>
                    <l>In his own temple, on the grunsel-edge,</l>
                    <l>Where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers:</l>
                    <l>Dagon his name, sea-monster, upward man</l>
                    <l>And downward fish; yet had his temple high</l>
                    <l>Reared in Azotus, dreaded through the coast</l>
                    <l>Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon,</l>
                    <l>And Accaron and Gaza’s frontier bounds.</l>
                    <l>Him followed Rimmon, whose delightful seat</l>
                    <l>Was fair Damascus, on the fertile banks</l>
                    <l>Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams.</l>
                    <l>He also against the house of God was bold:</l>
                    <l>A leper once he lost, and gained a king—</l>
                    <l>Ahaz, his sottish conqueror, whom he drew</l>
                    <l>God’s altar to disparage and displace</l>
                    <l>For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn</l>
                    <l>His odious offerings, and adore the gods</l>
                    <l>Whom he had vanquished. After these appeared</l>
                    <l>A crew who, under names of old renown—</l>
                    <l>Osiris, Isis, Orus, and their train—</l>
                    <l>With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused</l>
                    <l>Fanatic Egypt and her priests to seek</l>
                    <l>Their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms</l>
                    <l>Rather than human. Nor did Israel scape</l>
                    <l>Th’ infection, when their borrowed gold composed</l>
                    <l>The calf in Oreb; and the rebel king</l>
                    <l>Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan,</l>
                    <l>Likening his Maker to the grazed ox—</l>
                    <l>Jehovah, who, in one night, when he passed</l>
                    <l>From Egypt marching, equalled with one stroke</l>
                    <l>Both her first-born and all her bleating gods.</l>
                    <l>Belial came last; than whom a Spirit more lewd</l>
                    <l>Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love</l>
                    <l>Vice for itself. To him no temple stood</l>
                    <l>Or altar smoked; yet who more oft than he</l>
                    <l>In temples and at altars, when the priest</l>
                    <l>Turns atheist, as did Eli’s sons, who filled</l>
                    <l>With lust and violence the house of God?</l>
                    <l>In courts and palaces he also reigns,</l>
                    <l>And in luxurious cities, where the noise</l>
                    <l>Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers,</l>
                    <l>And injury and outrage; and, when night</l>
                    <l>Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons</l>
                    <l>Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.</l>
                    <l>Witness the streets of Sodom, and that night</l>
                    <l>In Gibeah, when the hospitable door</l>
                    <l>Exposed a matron, to avoid worse rape.</l>
                </lg>
            </p>
            <p>
                <lg>
                    <l>These were the prime in order and in might:</l>
                    <l>The rest were long to tell; though far renowned</l>
                    <l>Th’ Ionian gods—of Javan’s issue held</l>
                    <l>Gods, yet confessed later than Heaven and Earth,</l>
                    <l>Their boasted parents;—Titan, Heaven’s first-born,</l>
                    <l>With his enormous brood, and birthright seized</l>
                    <l>By younger Saturn: he from mightier Jove,</l>
                    <l>His own and Rhea’s son, like measure found;</l>
                    <l>So Jove usurping reigned. These, first in Crete</l>
                    <l>And Ida known, thence on the snowy top</l>
                    <l>Of cold Olympus ruled the middle air,</l>
                    <l>Their highest heaven; or on the Delphian cliff,</l>
                    <l>Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds</l>
                    <l>Of Doric land; or who with Saturn old</l>
                    <l>Fled over Adria to th’ Hesperian fields,</l>
                    <l>And o’er the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles.</l>
                </lg>
            </p>
            <p>
                <lg>
                    <l>All these and more came flocking; but with looks</l>
                    <l>Downcast and damp; yet such wherein appeared</l>
                    <l>Obscure some glimpse of joy to have found their Chief</l>
                    <l>Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost</l>
                    <l>In loss itself; which on his countenance cast</l>
                    <l>Like doubtful hue. But he, his wonted pride</l>
                    <l>Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore</l>
                    <l>Semblance of worth, not substance, gently raised</l>
                    <l>Their fainting courage, and dispelled their fears.</l>
                    <l>Then straight commands that, at the warlike sound</l>
                    <l>Of trumpets loud and clarions, be upreared</l>
                    <l>His mighty standard. That proud honour claimed</l>
                    <l>Azazel as his right, a Cherub tall:</l>
                    <l>Who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled</l>
                    <l>Th’ imperial ensign; which, full high advanced,</l>
                    <l>Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind,</l>
                    <l>With gems and golden lustre rich emblazed,</l>
                    <l>Seraphic arms and trophies; all the while</l>
                    <l>Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds:</l>
                    <l>At which the universal host up-sent</l>
                    <l>A shout that tore Hell’s concave, and beyond</l>
                    <l>Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night.</l>
                    <l>All in a moment through the gloom were seen</l>
                    <l>Ten thousand banners rise into the air,</l>
                    <l>With orient colours waving: with them rose</l>
                    <l>A forest huge of spears; and thronging helms</l>
                    <l>Appeared, and serried shields in thick array</l>
                    <l>Of depth immeasurable. Anon they move</l>
                    <l>In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood</l>
                    <l>Of flutes and soft recorders—such as raised</l>
                    <l>To height of noblest temper heroes old</l>
                    <l>Arming to battle, and instead of rage</l>
                    <l>Deliberate valour breathed, firm, and unmoved</l>
                    <l>With dread of death to flight or foul retreat;</l>
                    <l>Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage</l>
                    <l>With solemn touches troubled thoughts, and chase</l>
                    <l>Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain</l>
                    <l>From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they,</l>
                    <l>Breathing united force with fixed thought,</l>
                    <l>Moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed</l>
                    <l>Their painful steps o’er the burnt soil. And now</l>
                    <l>Advanced in view they stand—a horrid front</l>
                    <l>Of dreadful length and dazzling arms, in guise</l>
                    <l>Of warriors old, with ordered spear and shield,</l>
                    <l>Awaiting what command their mighty Chief</l>
                    <l>Had to impose. He through the armed files</l>
                    <l>Darts his experienced eye, and soon traverse</l>
                    <l>The whole battalion views—their order due,</l>
                    <l>Their visages and stature as of gods;</l>
                    <l>Their number last he sums. And now his heart</l>
                    <l>Distends with pride, and, hardening in his strength,</l>
                    <l>Glories: for never, since created Man,</l>
                    <l>Met such embodied force as, named with these,</l>
                    <l>Could merit more than that small infantry</l>
                    <l>Warred on by cranes—though all the giant brood</l>
                    <l>Of Phlegra with th’ heroic race were joined</l>
                    <l>That fought at Thebes and Ilium, on each side</l>
                    <l>Mixed with auxiliar gods; and what resounds</l>
                    <l>In fable or romance of Uther’s son,</l>
                    <l>Begirt with British and Armoric knights;</l>
                    <l>And all who since, baptized or infidel,</l>
                    <l>Jousted in Aspramont, or Montalban,</l>
                    <l>Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond,</l>
                    <l>Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore</l>
                    <l>When Charlemain with all his peerage fell</l>
                    <l>By Fontarabbia. Thus far these beyond</l>
                    <l>Compare of mortal prowess, yet observed</l>
                    <l>Their dread Commander. He, above the rest</l>
                    <l>In shape and gesture proudly eminent,</l>
                    <l>Stood like a tower. His form had yet not lost</l>
                    <l>All her original brightness, nor appeared</l>
                    <l>Less than Archangel ruined, and th’ excess</l>
                    <l>Of glory obscured: as when the sun new-risen</l>
                    <l>Looks through the horizontal misty air</l>
                    <l>Shorn of his beams, or, from behind the moon,</l>
                    <l>In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds</l>
                    <l>On half the nations, and with fear of change</l>
                    <l>Perplexes monarchs. Darkened so, yet shone</l>
                    <l>Above them all th’ Archangel: but his face</l>
                    <l>Deep scars of thunder had intrenched, and care</l>
                    <l>Sat on his faded cheek, but under brows</l>
                    <l>Of dauntless courage, and considerate pride</l>
                    <l>Waiting revenge. Cruel his eye, but cast</l>
                    <l>Signs of remorse and passion, to behold</l>
                    <l>The fellows of his crime, the followers rather</l>
                    <l>(Far other once beheld in bliss), condemned</l>
                    <l>For ever now to have their lot in pain—</l>
                    <l>Millions of Spirits for his fault amerced</l>
                    <l>Of Heaven, and from eternal splendours flung</l>
                    <l>For his revolt—yet faithful how they stood,</l>
                    <l>Their glory withered; as, when heaven’s fire</l>
                    <l>Hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines,</l>
                    <l>With singed top their stately growth, though bare,</l>
                    <l>Stands on the blasted heath. He now prepared</l>
                    <l>To speak; whereat their doubled ranks they bend</l>
                    <l>From wing to wing, and half enclose him round</l>
                    <l>With all his peers: attention held them mute.</l>
                    <l>Thrice he assayed, and thrice, in spite of scorn,</l>
                    <l>Tears, such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last</l>
                    <l>Words interwove with sighs found out their way:—</l>
                </lg>

                    <l>“O myriads of immortal Spirits! O Powers</l>
                    <l>Matchless, but with th’ Almighty!—and that strife</l>
                    <l>Was not inglorious, though th’ event was dire,</l>
                    <l>As this place testifies, and this dire change,</l>
                    <l>Hateful to utter. But what power of mind,</l>
                    <l>Forseeing or presaging, from the depth</l>
                    <l>Of knowledge past or present, could have feared</l>
                    <l>How such united force of gods, how such</l>
                    <l>As stood like these, could ever know repulse?</l>
                    <l>For who can yet believe, though after loss,</l>
                    <l>That all these puissant legions, whose exile</l>
                    <l>Hath emptied Heaven, shall fail to re-ascend,</l>
                    <l>Self-raised, and repossess their native seat?</l>
                    <l>For me, be witness all the host of Heaven,</l>
                    <l>If counsels different, or danger shunned</l>
                    <l>By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns</l>
                    <l>Monarch in Heaven till then as one secure</l>
                    <l>Sat on his throne, upheld by old repute,</l>
                    <l>Consent or custom, and his regal state</l>
                    <l>Put forth at full, but still his strength concealed—</l>
                    <l>Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.</l>
                    <l>Henceforth his might we know, and know our own,</l>
                    <l>So as not either to provoke, or dread</l>
                    <l>New war provoked: our better part remains</l>
                    <l>To work in close design, by fraud or guile,</l>
                    <l>What force effected not; that he no less</l>
                    <l>At length from us may find, who overcomes</l>
                    <l>By force hath overcome but half his foe.</l>
                    <l>Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife</l>
                    <l>There went a fame in Heaven that he ere long</l>
                    <l>Intended to create, and therein plant</l>
                    <l>A generation whom his choice regard</l>
                    <l>Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven.</l>
                    <l>Thither, if but to pry, shall be perhaps</l>
                    <l>Our first eruption—thither, or elsewhere;</l>
                    <l>For this infernal pit shall never hold</l>
                    <l>Celestial Spirits in bondage, nor th’ Abyss</l>
                    <l>Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts</l>
                    <l>Full counsel must mature. Peace is despaired;</l>
                    <l>For who can think submission? War, then, war</l>
                    <l>Open or understood, must be resolved.”</l>

                    <l>He spake; and, to confirm his words, outflew</l>
                    <l>Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs</l>
                    <l>Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze</l>
                    <l>Far round illumined Hell. Highly they raged</l>
                    <l>Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arms</l>
                    <l>Clashed on their sounding shields the din of war,</l>
                    <l>Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heaven.</l>

                    <l>There stood a hill not far, whose grisly top</l>
                    <l>Belched fire and rolling smoke; the rest entire</l>
                    <l>Shone with a glossy scurf—undoubted sign</l>
                    <l>That in his womb was hid metallic ore,</l>
                    <l>The work of sulphur. Thither, winged with speed,</l>
                    <l>A numerous brigade hastened: as when bands</l>
                    <l>Of pioneers, with spade and pickaxe armed,</l>
                    <l>Forerun the royal camp, to trench a field,</l>
                    <l>Or cast a rampart. Mammon led them on—</l>
                    <l>Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell</l>
                    <l>From Heaven; for even in Heaven his looks and thoughts</l>
                    <l>Were always downward bent, admiring more</l>
                    <l>The riches of heaven’s pavement, trodden gold,</l>
                    <l>Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed</l>
                    <l>In vision beatific. By him first</l>
                    <l>Men also, and by his suggestion taught,</l>
                    <l>Ransacked the centre, and with impious hands</l>
                    <l>Rifled the bowels of their mother Earth</l>
                    <l>For treasures better hid. Soon had his crew</l>
                    <l>Opened into the hill a spacious wound,</l>
                    <l>And digged out ribs of gold. Let none admire</l>
                    <l>That riches grow in Hell; that soil may best</l>
                    <l>Deserve the precious bane. And here let those</l>
                    <l>Who boast in mortal things, and wondering tell</l>
                    <l>Of Babel, and the works of Memphian kings,</l>
                    <l>Learn how their greatest monuments of fame</l>
                    <l>And strength, and art, are easily outdone</l>
                    <l>By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour</l>
                    <l>What in an age they, with incessant toil</l>
                    <l>And hands innumerable, scarce perform.</l>
                    <l>Nigh on the plain, in many cells prepared,</l>
                    <l>That underneath had veins of liquid fire</l>
                    <l>Sluiced from the lake, a second multitude</l>
                    <l>With wondrous art founded the massy ore,</l>
                    <l>Severing each kind, and scummed the bullion-dross.</l>
                    <l>A third as soon had formed within the ground</l>
                    <l>A various mould, and from the boiling cells</l>
                    <l>By strange conveyance filled each hollow nook;</l>
                    <l>As in an organ, from one blast of wind,</l>
                    <l>To many a row of pipes the sound-board breathes.</l>
                    <l>Anon out of the earth a fabric huge</l>
                    <l>Rose like an exhalation, with the sound</l>
                    <l>Of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet—</l>
                    <l>Built like a temple, where pilasters round</l>
                    <l>Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid</l>
                    <l>With golden architrave; nor did there want</l>
                    <l>Cornice or frieze, with bossy sculptures graven;</l>
                    <l>The roof was fretted gold. Not Babylon</l>
                    <l>Nor great Alcairo such magnificence</l>
                    <l>Equalled in all their glories, to enshrine</l>
                    <l>Belus or Serapis their gods, or seat</l>
                    <l>Their kings, when Egypt with Assyria strove</l>
                    <l>In wealth and luxury. Th’ ascending pile</l>
                    <l>Stood fixed her stately height, and straight the doors,</l>
                    <l>Opening their brazen folds, discover, wide</l>
                    <l>Within, her ample spaces o’er the smooth</l>
                    <l>And level pavement: from the arched roof,</l>
                    <l>Pendent by subtle magic, many a row</l>
                    <l>Of starry lamps and blazing cressets, fed</l>
                    <l>With naptha and asphaltus, yielded light</l>
                    <l>As from a sky. The hasty multitude</l>
                    <l>Admiring entered; and the work some praise,</l>
                    <l>And some the architect. His hand was known</l>
                    <l>In Heaven by many a towered structure high,</l>
                    <l>Where sceptred Angels held their residence,</l>
                    <l>And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King</l>
                    <l>Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,</l>
                    <l>Each in his Hierarchy, the Orders bright.</l>
                    <l>Nor was his name unheard or unadored</l>
                    <l>In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land</l>
                    <l>Men called him Mulciber; and how he fell</l>
                    <l>From Heaven they fabled, thrown by angry Jove</l>
                    <l>Sheer o’er the crystal battlements: from morn</l>
                    <l>To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,</l>
                    <l>A summer’s day, and with the setting sun</l>
                    <l>Dropt from the zenith, like a falling star,</l>
                    <l>On Lemnos, th’ Aegaean isle. Thus they relate,</l>
                    <l>Erring; for he with this rebellious rout</l>
                    <l>Fell long before; nor aught availed him now</l>
                    <l>To have built in Heaven high towers; nor did he scape</l>
                    <l>By all his engines, but was headlong sent,</l>
                    <l>With his industrious crew, to build in Hell.</l>
                </lg>
            </p>
            <p>
                <lg>
                    <l>Meanwhile the winged Heralds, by command</l>
                    <l>Of sovereign power, with awful ceremony</l>
                    <l>And trumpet’s sound, throughout the host proclaim</l>
                    <l>A solemn council forthwith to be held</l>
                    <l>At Pandemonium, the high capital</l>
                    <l>Of Satan and his peers. Their summons called</l>
                    <l>From every band and squared regiment</l>
                    <l>By place or choice the worthiest: they anon</l>
                    <l>With hundreds and with thousands trooping came</l>
                    <l>Attended. All access was thronged; the gates</l>
                    <l>And porches wide, but chief the spacious hall</l>
                    <l>(Though like a covered field, where champions bold</l>
                    <l>Wont ride in armed, and at the Soldan’s chair</l>
                    <l>Defied the best of Paynim chivalry</l>
                    <l>To mortal combat, or career with lance),</l>
                    <l>Thick swarmed, both on the ground and in the air,</l>
                    <l>Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings. As bees</l>
                    <l>In spring-time, when the Sun with Taurus rides.</l>
                    <l>Pour forth their populous youth about the hive</l>
                    <l>In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers</l>
                    <l>Fly to and fro, or on the smoothed plank,</l>
                    <l>The suburb of their straw-built citadel,</l>
                    <l>New rubbed with balm, expatiate, and confer</l>
                    <l>Their state-affairs: so thick the airy crowd</l>
                    <l>Swarmed and were straitened; till, the signal given,</l>
                    <l>Behold a wonder! They but now who seemed</l>
                    <l>In bigness to surpass Earth’s giant sons,</l>
                    <l>Now less than smallest dwarfs, in narrow room</l>
                    <l>Throng numberless—like that pygmean race</l>
                    <l>Beyond the Indian mount; or faery elves,</l>
                    <l>Whose midnight revels, by a forest-side</l>
                    <l>Or fountain, some belated peasant sees,</l>
                    <l>Or dreams he sees, while overhead the Moon</l>
                    <l>Sits arbitress, and nearer to the Earth</l>
                    <l>Wheels her pale course: they, on their mirth and dance</l>
                    <l>Intent, with jocund music charm his ear;</l>
                    <l>At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.</l>
                    <l>Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms</l>
                    <l>Reduced their shapes immense, and were at large,</l>
                    <l>Though without number still, amidst the hall</l>
                    <l>Of that infernal court. But far within,</l>
                    <l>And in their own dimensions like themselves,</l>
                    <l>The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim</l>
                    <l>In close recess and secret conclave sat,</l>
                    <l>A thousand demi-gods on golden seats,</l>
                    <l>Frequent and full. After short silence then,</l>
                    <l>And summons read, the great consult began.</l>

                    <l>More than can be in Heaven, we now return</l>

                    <l>Main reason to persuade immediate war</l>

                    <l>Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.</l>
                    <l>First, what revenge? The towers of Heaven are filled</l>
                    <l>With armed watch, that render all access</l>
                    <l>Impregnable: oft on the bordering Deep</l>

                    <l>Scout far and wide into the realm of Night,</l>

                    <l>By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise</l>
                    <l>With blackest insurrection to confound</l>
                    <l>Heaven’s purest light, yet our great Enemy,</l>
                    <l>All incorruptible, would on his throne</l>
                    <l>Sit unpolluted, and th’ ethereal mould,</l>
                    <l>Incapable of stain, would soon expel</l>
                    <l>Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire,</l>
                    <l>Victorious. Thus repulsed, our final hope</l>

                    <l>Can give it, or will ever? How he can</l>
                    <l>Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.</l>
                    <l>Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,</l>

                    <l>Whatever doing, what can we suffer more,</l>
                    <l>What can we suffer worse?” Is this, then, worst—</l>
                    <l>Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in arms?</l>
                    <l>What when we fled amain, pursued and struck</l>

                    <l>The Deep to shelter us? This Hell then seemed</l>
                    <l>A refuge from those wounds. Or when we lay</l>
                    <l>Chained on the burning lake? That sure was worse.</l>
                    <l>What if the breath that kindled those grim fires,</l>
                    <l>Awaked, should blow them into sevenfold rage,</l>
                    <l>And plunge us in the flames; or from above</l>
                    <l>Should intermitted vengeance arm again</l>
                    <l>His red right hand to plague us? What if all</l>
                    <l>Her stores were opened, and this firmament</l>
                    <l>Of Hell should spout her cataracts of fire,</l>
                    <l>Impendent horrors, threatening hideous fall</l>
                    <l>One day upon our heads; while we perhaps,</l>
                    <l>Designing or exhorting glorious war,</l>
                    <l>Caught in a fiery tempest, shall be hurled,</l>
                    <l>Each on his rock transfixed, the sport and prey</l>
                    <l>Or racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk</l>
                    <l>Under yon boiling ocean, wrapt in chains,</l>
                    <l>There to converse with everlasting groans,</l>
                    <l>Unrespited, unpitied, unreprieved,</l>
                    <l>Ages of hopeless end? This would be worse.</l>
                    <l>War, therefore, open or concealed, alike</l>
                    <l>My voice dissuades; for what can force or guile</l>
                    <l>With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye</l>
                    <l>Views all things at one view? He from Heaven’s height</l>
                    <l>All these our motions vain sees and derides,</l>
                    <l>Not more almighty to resist our might</l>
                    <l>Than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.</l>
                    <l>Shall we, then, live thus vile—the race of Heaven</l>
                    <l>Thus trampled, thus expelled, to suffer here</l>
                    <l>Chains and these torments? Better these than worse,</l>
                    <l>By my advice; since fate inevitable</l>
                    <l>Subdues us, and omnipotent decree,</l>
                    <l>The Victor’s will. To suffer, as to do,</l>
                    <l>Our strength is equal; nor the law unjust</l>
                    <l>That so ordains. This was at first resolved,</l>

                    <l>Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.</l>
                    <l>I laugh when those who at the spear are bold</l>
                    <l>And venturous, if that fail them, shrink, and fear</l>
                    <l>What yet they know must follow—to endure</l>
                    <l>Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,</l>
                    <l>The sentence of their Conqueror. This is now</l>
                    <l>Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear,</l>
                    <l>Our Supreme Foe in time may much remit</l>
                    <l>His anger, and perhaps, thus far removed,</l>
                    <l>Not mind us not offending, satisfied</l>
                    <l>With what is punished; whence these raging fires</l>
                    <l>Will slacken, if his breath stir not their flames.</l>
                    <l>Our purer essence then will overcome</l>
                    <l>Their noxious vapour; or, inured, not feel;</l>

                    <l>In temper and in nature, will receive</l>

                    <l>The former, vain to hope, argues as vain</l>
                    <l>The latter; for what place can be for us</l>
                    <l>Within Heaven’s bound, unless Heaven’s Lord supreme</l>
                    <l>We overpower? Suppose he should relent</l>
                    <l>And publish grace to all, on promise made</l>
                    <l>Of new subjection; with what eyes could we</l>
                    <l>Stand in his presence humble, and receive</l>
                    <l>Strict laws imposed, to celebrate his throne</l>
                    <l>With warbled hymns, and to his Godhead sing</l>
                    <l>Forced hallelujahs, while he lordly sits</l>
                    <l>Our envied sovereign, and his altar breathes</l>
                    <l>Ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers,</l>
                    <l>Our servile offerings? This must be our task</l>
                    <l>In Heaven, this our delight. How wearisome</l>
                    <l>Eternity so spent in worship paid</l>
                    <l>To whom we hate! Let us not then pursue,</l>
                    <l>By force impossible, by leave obtained</l>
                    <l>Unacceptable, though in Heaven, our state</l>
                    <l>Of splendid vassalage; but rather seek</l>
                    <l>Our own good from ourselves, and from our own</l>
                    <l>Live to ourselves, though in this vast recess,</l>
                    <l>Free and to none accountable, preferring</l>
                    <l>Hard liberty before the easy yoke</l>
                    <l>Of servile pomp. Our greatness will appear</l>
                    <l>Then most conspicuous when great things of small,</l>
                    <l>Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse,</l>
                    <l>We can create, and in what place soe’er</l>
                    <l>Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain</l>
                    <l>Through labour and endurance. This deep world</l>
                    <l>Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst</l>
                    <l>Thick clouds and dark doth Heaven’s all-ruling Sire</l>
                    <l>Choose to reside, his glory unobscured,</l>
                    <l>And with the majesty of darkness round</l>
                    <l>Covers his throne, from whence deep thunders roar.</l>
                    <l>Mustering their rage, and Heaven resembles Hell!</l>
                    <l>As he our darkness, cannot we his light</l>
                    <l>Imitate when we please? This desert soil</l>
                    <l>Wants not her hidden lustre, gems and gold;</l>
                    <l>Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise</l>
                    <l>Magnificence; and what can Heaven show more?</l>
                    <l>Our torments also may, in length of time,</l>
                    <l>Become our elements, these piercing fires</l>
                    <l>As soft as now severe, our temper changed</l>
                    <l>Into their temper; which must needs remove</l>
                    <l>The sensible of pain. All things invite</l>
                    <l>To peaceful counsels, and the settled state</l>
                    <l>Of order, how in safety best we may</l>
                    <l>Compose our present evils, with regard</l>
                    <l>Of what we are and where, dismissing quite</l>
                    <l>All thoughts of war. Ye have what I advise.”</l>

                    <l>He scarce had finished, when such murmur filled</l>
                    <l>Th’ assembly as when hollow rocks retain</l>
                    <l>The sound of blustering winds, which all night long</l>
                    <l>Had roused the sea, now with hoarse cadence lull</l>
                    <l>Seafaring men o’erwatched, whose bark by chance</l>
                    <l>Or pinnace, anchors in a craggy bay</l>
                    <l>After the tempest. Such applause was heard</l>
                    <l>As Mammon ended, and his sentence pleased,</l>
                    <l>Advising peace: for such another field</l>
                    <l>They dreaded worse than Hell; so much the fear</l>
                    <l>Of thunder and the sword of Michael</l>
                    <l>Wrought still within them; and no less desire</l>
                    <l>To found this nether empire, which might rise,</l>
                    <l>By policy and long process of time,</l>
                    <l>In emulation opposite to Heaven.</l>
                    <l>Which when Beelzebub perceived—than whom,</l>
                    <l>Satan except, none higher sat—with grave</l>
                    <l>Aspect he rose, and in his rising seemed</l>
                    <l>A pillar of state. Deep on his front engraven</l>
                    <l>Deliberation sat, and public care;</l>
                    <l>And princely counsel in his face yet shone,</l>
                    <l>Majestic, though in ruin. Sage he stood</l>
                    <l>With Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear</l>
                    <l>The weight of mightiest monarchies; his look</l>
                    <l>Drew audience and attention still as night</l>
                    <l>Or summer’s noontide air, while thus he spake:—</l>

                    <l>Must we renounce, and, changing style, be called</l>
                    <l>Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote</l>
                    <l>Inclines—here to continue, and build up here</l>
                    <l>A growing empire; doubtless! while we dream,</l>
                    <l>And know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed</l>
                    <l>This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat</l>
                    <l>Beyond his potent arm, to live exempt</l>
                    <l>From Heaven’s high jurisdiction, in new league</l>
                    <l>Banded against his throne, but to remain</l>
                    <l>In strictest bondage, though thus far removed,</l>
                    <l>Under th’ inevitable curb, reserved</l>
                    <l>His captive multitude. For he, to be sure,</l>
                    <l>In height or depth, still first and last will reign</l>
                    <l>Sole king, and of his kingdom lose no part</l>

                    <l>Us here, as with his golden those in Heaven.</l>
                    <l>What sit we then projecting peace and war?</l>
                    <l>War hath determined us and foiled with loss</l>
                    <l>Irreparable; terms of peace yet none</l>
                    <l>Vouchsafed or sought; for what peace will be given</l>
                    <l>To us enslaved, but custody severe,</l>
                    <l>And stripes and arbitrary punishment</l>
                    <l>Inflicted? and what peace can we return,</l>

                    <l>Untamed reluctance, and revenge, though slow,</l>
                    <l>Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least</l>
                    <l>May reap his conquest, and may least rejoice</l>
                    <l>In doing what we most in suffering feel?</l>
                    <l>Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need</l>
                    <l>With dangerous expedition to invade</l>
                    <l>Heaven, whose high walls fear no assault or siege,</l>
                    <l>Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find</l>
                    <l>Some easier enterprise? There is a place</l>
                    <l>(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven</l>
                    <l>Err not)—another World, the happy seat</l>
                    <l>Of some new race, called Man, about this time</l>
                    <l>To be created like to us, though less</l>
                    <l>In power and excellence, but favoured more</l>
                    <l>Of him who rules above; so was his will</l>
                    <l>Pronounced among the Gods, and by an oath</l>
                    <l>That shook Heaven’s whole circumference confirmed.</l>
                    <l>Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn</l>
                    <l>What creatures there inhabit, of what mould</l>
                    <l>Or substance, how endued, and what their power</l>
                    <l>And where their weakness: how attempted best,</l>
                    <l>By force or subtlety. Though Heaven be shut,</l>
                    <l>And Heaven’s high Arbitrator sit secure</l>
                    <l>In his own strength, this place may lie exposed,</l>
                    <l>The utmost border of his kingdom, left</l>
                    <l>To their defence who hold it: here, perhaps,</l>
                    <l>Some advantageous act may be achieved</l>
                    <l>By sudden onset—either with Hell-fire</l>
                    <l>To waste his whole creation, or possess</l>
                    <l>All as our own, and drive, as we were driven,</l>
                    <l>The puny habitants; or, if not drive,</l>
                    <l>Seduce them to our party, that their God</l>
                    <l>May prove their foe, and with repenting hand</l>
                    <l>Abolish his own works. This would surpass</l>
                    <l>Common revenge, and interrupt his joy</l>
                    <l>In our confusion, and our joy upraise</l>
                    <l>In his disturbance; when his darling sons,</l>
                    <l>Hurled headlong to partake with us, shall curse</l>
                    <l>Their frail original, and faded bliss—</l>
                    <l>Faded so soon! Advise if this be worth</l>
                    <l>Attempting, or to sit in darkness here</l>
                    <l>Hatching vain empires.” Thus Beelzebub</l>
                    <l>Pleaded his devilish counsel—first devised</l>
                    <l>By Satan, and in part proposed: for whence,</l>
                    <l>But from the author of all ill, could spring</l>
                    <l>So deep a malice, to confound the race</l>
                    <l>Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell</l>
                    <l>To mingle and involve, done all to spite</l>
                    <l>The great Creator? But their spite still serves</l>
                    <l>His glory to augment. The bold design</l>
                    <l>Pleased highly those infernal States, and joy</l>
                    <l>Sparkled in all their eyes: with full assent</l>
                    <l>They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews:—</l>
                    <l>“Well have ye judged, well ended long debate,</l>

                    <l>And opportune excursion, we may chance</l>
                    <l>Re-enter Heaven; or else in some mild zone</l>
                    <l>Dwell, not unvisited of Heaven’s fair light,</l>
                    <l>Secure, and at the brightening orient beam</l>

                    <l>To heal the scar of these corrosive fires,</l>
                    <l>Shall breathe her balm. But, first, whom shall we send</l>
                    <l>In search of this new World? whom shall we find</l>
                    <l>Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandering feet</l>
                    <l>The dark, unbottomed, infinite Abyss,</l>
                    <l>And through the palpable obscure find out</l>
                    <l>His uncouth way, or spread his airy flight,</l>
                    <l>Upborne with indefatigable wings</l>
                    <l>Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive</l>
                    <l>The happy Isle? What strength, what art, can then</l>
                    <l>Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe,</l>
                    <l>Through the strict senteries and stations thick</l>
                    <l>Of Angels watching round? Here he had need</l>
                    <l>All circumspection: and we now no less</l>
                    <l>Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send</l>
                    <l>The weight of all, and our last hope, relies.”</l>

                    <l>Me from attempting. Wherefore do I assume</l>
                    <l>These royalties, and not refuse to reign,</l>
                    <l>Refusing to accept as great a share</l>
                    <l>Of hazard as of honour, due alike</l>
                    <l>To him who reigns, and so much to him due</l>
                    <l>Of hazard more as he above the rest</l>
                    <l>High honoured sits? Go, therefore, mighty Powers,</l>
                    <l>Terror of Heaven, though fallen; intend at home,</l>
                    <l>While here shall be our home, what best may ease</l>
                    <l>The present misery, and render Hell</l>
                    <l>More tolerable; if there be cure or charm</l>
                    <l>To respite, or deceive, or slack the pain</l>
                    <l>Of this ill mansion: intermit no watch</l>
                    <l>Against a wakeful foe, while I abroad</l>
                    <l>Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek</l>
                    <l>Deliverance for us all. This enterprise</l>
                    <l>None shall partake with me.” Thus saying, rose</l>
                    <l>The Monarch, and prevented all reply;</l>
                    <l>Prudent lest, from his resolution raised,</l>
                    <l>Others among the chief might offer now,</l>
                    <l>Certain to be refused, what erst they feared,</l>
                    <l>And, so refused, might in opinion stand</l>
                    <l>His rivals, winning cheap the high repute</l>
                    <l>Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they</l>
                    <l>Dreaded not more th’ adventure than his voice</l>
                    <l>Forbidding; and at once with him they rose.</l>
                    <l>Their rising all at once was as the sound</l>
                    <l>Of thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend</l>
                    <l>With awful reverence prone, and as a God</l>
                    <l>Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaven.</l>
                    <l>Nor failed they to express how much they praised</l>
                    <l>That for the general safety he despised</l>
                    <l>His own: for neither do the Spirits damned</l>
                    <l>Lose all their virtue; lest bad men should boast</l>
                    <l>Their specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,</l>
                    <l>Or close ambition varnished o’er with zeal.</l>
                </lg>
            </p>
            <p>
                <lg>
                    <l>Thus they their doubtful consultations dark</l>
                    <l>Ended, rejoicing in their matchless Chief:</l>
                    <l>As, when from mountain-tops the dusky clouds</l>
                    <l>Ascending, while the north wind sleeps, o’erspread</l>
                    <l>Heaven’s cheerful face, the louring element</l>
                    <l>Scowls o’er the darkened landscape snow or shower,</l>
                    <l>If chance the radiant sun, with farewell sweet,</l>
                    <l>Extend his evening beam, the fields revive,</l>
                    <l>The birds their notes renew, and bleating herds</l>
                    <l>Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings.</l>
                    <l>O shame to men! Devil with devil damned</l>
                    <l>Firm concord holds; men only disagree</l>
                    <l>Of creatures rational, though under hope</l>
                    <l>Of heavenly grace, and, God proclaiming peace,</l>
                    <l>Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife</l>
                    <l>Among themselves, and levy cruel wars</l>
                    <l>Wasting the earth, each other to destroy:</l>
                    <l>As if (which might induce us to accord)</l>
                    <l>Man had not hellish foes enow besides,</l>
                    <l>That day and night for his destruction wait!</l>
                </lg>

            <p>
                <lg>
                    <l>The Stygian council thus dissolved; and forth</l>
                    <l>In order came the grand infernal Peers:</l>
                    <l>Midst came their mighty Paramount, and seemed</l>
                    <l>Alone th’ antagonist of Heaven, nor less</l>
                    <l>Than Hell’s dread Emperor, with pomp supreme,</l>
                    <l>And god-like imitated state: him round</l>
                    <l>A globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed</l>
                    <l>With bright emblazonry, and horrent arms.</l>
                    <l>Then of their session ended they bid cry</l>
                    <l>With trumpet’s regal sound the great result:</l>
                    <l>Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim</l>
                    <l>Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy,</l>
                    <l>By herald’s voice explained; the hollow Abyss</l>
                    <l>Heard far and wide, and all the host of Hell</l>
                    <l>With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim.</l>
                    <l>Thence more at ease their minds, and somewhat raised</l>
                    <l>By false presumptuous hope, the ranged Powers</l>
                    <l>Disband; and, wandering, each his several way</l>
                    <l>Pursues, as inclination or sad choice</l>
                    <l>Leads him perplexed, where he may likeliest find</l>
                    <l>Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain</l>
                    <l>The irksome hours, till his great Chief return.</l>
                    <l>Part on the plain, or in the air sublime,</l>
                    <l>Upon the wing or in swift race contend,</l>
                    <l>As at th’ Olympian games or Pythian fields;</l>
                    <l>Part curb their fiery steeds, or shun the goal</l>
                    <l>With rapid wheels, or fronted brigades form:</l>
                    <l>As when, to warn proud cities, war appears</l>
                    <l>Waged in the troubled sky, and armies rush</l>
                    <l>To battle in the clouds; before each van</l>
                    <l>Prick forth the airy knights, and couch their spears,</l>
                    <l>Till thickest legions close; with feats of arms</l>
                    <l>From either end of heaven the welkin burns.</l>
                    <l>Others, with vast Typhoean rage, more fell,</l>
                    <l>Rend up both rocks and hills, and ride the air</l>
                    <l>In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wild uproar:—</l>
                    <l>As when Alcides, from Oechalia crowned</l>
                    <l>With conquest, felt th’ envenomed robe, and tore</l>
                    <l>Through pain up by the roots Thessalian pines,</l>
                    <l>And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw</l>
                    <l>Into th’ Euboic sea. Others, more mild,</l>
                    <l>Retreated in a silent valley, sing</l>
                    <l>With notes angelical to many a harp</l>
                    <l>Their own heroic deeds, and hapless fall</l>
                    <l>By doom of battle, and complain that Fate</l>
                    <l>Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance.</l>
                    <l>Their song was partial; but the harmony</l>
                    <l>(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)</l>
                    <l>Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment</l>
                    <l>The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet</l>
                    <l>(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense)</l>
                    <l>Others apart sat on a hill retired,</l>
                    <l>In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high</l>
                    <l>Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate—</l>
                    <l>Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,</l>
                    <l>And found no end, in wandering mazes lost.</l>
                    <l>Of good and evil much they argued then,</l>
                    <l>Of happiness and final misery,</l>
                    <l>Passion and apathy, and glory and shame:</l>
                    <l>Vain wisdom all, and false philosophy!—</l>
                    <l>Yet, with a pleasing sorcery, could charm</l>
                    <l>Pain for a while or anguish, and excite</l>
                    <l>Fallacious hope, or arm th’ obdured breast</l>
                    <l>With stubborn patience as with triple steel.</l>
                    <l>Another part, in squadrons and gross bands,</l>
                    <l>On bold adventure to discover wide</l>
                    <l>That dismal world, if any clime perhaps</l>
                    <l>Might yield them easier habitation, bend</l>
                    <l>Four ways their flying march, along the banks</l>
                    <l>Of four infernal rivers, that disgorge</l>
                    <l>Into the burning lake their baleful streams—</l>
                    <l>Abhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate;</l>
                    <l>Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep;</l>
                    <l>Cocytus, named of lamentation loud</l>
                    <l>Heard on the rueful stream; fierce Phlegeton,</l>
                    <l>Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.</l>
                    <l>Far off from these, a slow and silent stream,</l>
                    <l>Lethe, the river of oblivion, rolls</l>
                    <l>Her watery labyrinth, whereof who drinks</l>
                    <l>Forthwith his former state and being forgets—</l>
                    <l>Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.</l>
                    <l>Beyond this flood a frozen continent</l>
                    <l>Lies dark and wild, beat with perpetual storms</l>
                    <l>Of whirlwind and dire hail, which on firm land</l>
                    <l>Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems</l>
                    <l>Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,</l>
                    <l>A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog</l>
                    <l>Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old,</l>
                    <l>Where armies whole have sunk: the parching air</l>
                    <l>Burns frore, and cold performs th’ effect of fire.</l>
                    <l>Thither, by harpy-footed Furies haled,</l>
                    <l>At certain revolutions all the damned</l>
                    <l>Are brought; and feel by turns the bitter change</l>
                    <l>Of fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce,</l>
                    <l>From beds of raging fire to starve in ice</l>
                    <l>Their soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine</l>
                    <l>Immovable, infixed, and frozen round</l>
                    <l>Periods of time,—thence hurried back to fire.</l>
                    <l>They ferry over this Lethean sound</l>
                    <l>Both to and fro, their sorrow to augment,</l>
                    <l>And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach</l>
                    <l>The tempting stream, with one small drop to lose</l>
                    <l>In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,</l>
                    <l>All in one moment, and so near the brink;</l>
                    <l>But Fate withstands, and, to oppose th’ attempt,</l>
                    <l>Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards</l>
                    <l>The ford, and of itself the water flies</l>
                    <l>All taste of living wight, as once it fled</l>
                    <l>The lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on</l>
                    <l>In confused march forlorn, th’ adventurous bands,</l>
                    <l>With shuddering horror pale, and eyes aghast,</l>
                    <l>Viewed first their lamentable lot, and found</l>
                    <l>No rest. Through many a dark and dreary vale</l>
                    <l>They passed, and many a region dolorous,</l>
                    <l>O’er many a frozen, many a fiery alp,</l>
                    <l>Rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death—</l>
                    <l>A universe of death, which God by curse</l>
                    <l>Created evil, for evil only good;</l>
                    <l>Where all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds,</l>
                    <l>Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,</l>
                    <l>Obominable, inutterable, and worse</l>
                    <l>Than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived,</l>
                    <l>Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimeras dire.</l>

                    <l>Meanwhile the Adversary of God and Man,</l>
                    <l>Satan, with thoughts inflamed of highest design,</l>
                    <l>Puts on swift wings, and toward the gates of Hell</l>
                    <l>Explores his solitary flight: sometimes</l>
                    <l>He scours the right hand coast, sometimes the left;</l>
                    <l>Now shaves with level wing the deep, then soars</l>
                    <l>Up to the fiery concave towering high.</l>
                    <l>As when far off at sea a fleet descried</l>
                    <l>Hangs in the clouds, by equinoctial winds</l>
                    <l>Close sailing from Bengala, or the isles</l>
                    <l>Of Ternate and Tidore, whence merchants bring</l>
                    <l>Their spicy drugs; they on the trading flood,</l>
                    <l>Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape,</l>
                    <l>Ply stemming nightly toward the pole: so seemed</l>
                    <l>Far off the flying Fiend. At last appear</l>
                    <l>Hell-bounds, high reaching to the horrid roof,</l>
                    <l>And thrice threefold the gates; three folds were brass,</l>
                    <l>Three iron, three of adamantine rock,</l>
                    <l>Impenetrable, impaled with circling fire,</l>
                    <l>Yet unconsumed. Before the gates there sat</l>
                    <l>On either side a formidable Shape.</l>
                    <l>The one seemed woman to the waist, and fair,</l>
                    <l>But ended foul in many a scaly fold,</l>
                    <l>Voluminous and vast—a serpent armed</l>
                    <l>With mortal sting. About her middle round</l>
                    <l>A cry of Hell-hounds never-ceasing barked</l>
                    <l>With wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung</l>
                    <l>A hideous peal; yet, when they list, would creep,</l>
                    <l>If aught disturbed their noise, into her womb,</l>
                    <l>And kennel there; yet there still barked and howled</l>
                    <l>Within unseen. Far less abhorred than these</l>
                    <l>Vexed Scylla, bathing in the sea that parts</l>
                    <l>Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore;</l>
                    <l>Nor uglier follow the night-hag, when, called</l>
                    <l>In secret, riding through the air she comes,</l>
                    <l>Lured with the smell of infant blood, to dance</l>

                    <l>Satan was now at hand, and from his seat</l>

                    <l>In Heaven, when at th’ assembly, and in sight</l>
                    <l>Of all the Seraphim with thee combined</l>
                    <l>In bold conspiracy against Heaven’s King,</l>
                    <l>All on a sudden miserable pain</l>
                    <l>Surprised thee, dim thine eyes and dizzy swum</l>
                    <l>In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast</l>
                    <l>Threw forth, till on the left side opening wide,</l>
                    <l>Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright,</l>
                    <l>Then shining heavenly fair, a goddess armed,</l>
                    <l>Out of thy head I sprung. Amazement seized</l>
                    <l>All th’ host of Heaven; back they recoiled afraid</l>
                    <l>At first, and called me Sin, and for a sign</l>
                    <l>Portentous held me; but, familiar grown,</l>
                    <l>I pleased, and with attractive graces won</l>
                    <l>The most averse—thee chiefly, who, full oft</l>
                    <l>Thyself in me thy perfect image viewing,</l>
                    <l>Becam’st enamoured; and such joy thou took’st</l>
                    <l>With me in secret that my womb conceived</l>
                    <l>A growing burden. Meanwhile war arose,</l>
                    <l>And fields were fought in Heaven: wherein remained</l>

                    <l>Clear victory; to our part loss and rout</l>
                    <l>Through all the Empyrean. Down they fell,</l>
                    <l>Driven headlong from the pitch of Heaven, down</l>
                    <l>Into this Deep; and in the general fall</l>
                    <l>I also: at which time this powerful key</l>
                    <l>Into my hands was given, with charge to keep</l>
                    <l>These gates for ever shut, which none can pass</l>
                    <l>Without my opening. Pensive here I sat</l>

                    <l>Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew</l>
                    <l>Transformed: but he my inbred enemy</l>
                    <l>Forth issued, brandishing his fatal dart,</l>
                    <l>Made to destroy. I fled, and cried out Death!</l>
                    <l>Hell trembled at the hideous name, and sighed</l>
                    <l>From all her caves, and back resounded Death!</l>
                    <l>I fled; but he pursued (though more, it seems,</l>
                    <l>Inflamed with lust than rage), and, swifter far,</l>
                    <l>Me overtook, his mother, all dismayed,</l>
                    <l>And, in embraces forcible and foul</l>
                    <l>Engendering with me, of that rape begot</l>
                    <l>These yelling monsters, that with ceaseless cry</l>
                    <l>Surround me, as thou saw’st—hourly conceived</l>
                    <l>And hourly born, with sorrow infinite</l>
                    <l>To me; for, when they list, into the womb</l>
                    <l>That bred them they return, and howl, and gnaw</l>
                    <l>My bowels, their repast; then, bursting forth</l>
                    <l>Afresh, with conscious terrors vex me round,</l>
                    <l>That rest or intermission none I find.</l>
                    <l>Before mine eyes in opposition sits</l>
                    <l>Grim Death, my son and foe, who set them on,</l>
                    <l>And me, his parent, would full soon devour</l>
                    <l>For want of other prey, but that he knows</l>
                    <l>His end with mine involved, and knows that I</l>
                    <l>Should prove a bitter morsel, and his bane,</l>
                    <l>Whenever that shall be: so Fate pronounced.</l>
                    <l>But thou, O father, I forewarn thee, shun</l>
                    <l>His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope</l>
                    <l>To be invulnerable in those bright arms,</l>
                    <l>Through tempered heavenly; for that mortal dint,</l>

                    <l>My being gav’st me; whom should I obey</l>
                    <l>But thee? whom follow? Thou wilt bring me soon</l>
                    <l>To that new world of light and bliss, among</l>
                    <l>The gods who live at ease, where I shall reign</l>
                    <l>At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems</l>
                    <l>Thy daughter and thy darling, without end.”</l>
                </lg>

            <p>
                <lg>
                    <l>Thus saying, from her side the fatal key,</l>
                    <l>Sad instrument of all our woe, she took;</l>
                    <l>And, towards the gate rolling her bestial train,</l>
                    <l>Forthwith the huge portcullis high up-drew,</l>
                    <l>Which, but herself, not all the Stygian Powers</l>
                    <l>Could once have moved; then in the key-hole turns</l>
                    <l>Th’ intricate wards, and every bolt and bar</l>
                    <l>Of massy iron or solid rock with ease</l>
                    <l>Unfastens. On a sudden open fly,</l>
                    <l>With impetuous recoil and jarring sound,</l>
                    <l>Th’ infernal doors, and on their hinges grate</l>
                    <l>Harsh thunder, that the lowest bottom shook</l>
                    <l>Of Erebus. She opened; but to shut</l>
                    <l>Excelled her power: the gates wide open stood,</l>
                    <l>That with extended wings a bannered host,</l>
                    <l>Under spread ensigns marching, might pass through</l>
                    <l>With horse and chariots ranked in loose array;</l>
                    <l>So wide they stood, and like a furnace-mouth</l>
                    <l>Cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame.</l>
                    <l>Before their eyes in sudden view appear</l>
                    <l>The secrets of the hoary Deep—a dark</l>
                    <l>Illimitable ocean, without bound,</l>
                    <l>Without dimension; where length, breadth, and height,</l>
                    <l>And time, and place, are lost; where eldest Night</l>
                    <l>And Chaos, ancestors of Nature, hold</l>
                    <l>Eternal anarchy, amidst the noise</l>
                    <l>Of endless wars, and by confusion stand.</l>
                    <l>For Hot, Cold, Moist, and Dry, four champions fierce,</l>
                    <l>Strive here for mastery, and to battle bring</l>
                    <l>Their embryon atoms: they around the flag</l>
                    <l>Of each his faction, in their several clans,</l>
                    <l>Light-armed or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift, or slow,</l>
                    <l>Swarm populous, unnumbered as the sands</l>
                    <l>Of Barca or Cyrene’s torrid soil,</l>
                    <l>Levied to side with warring winds, and poise</l>
                    <l>Their lighter wings. To whom these most adhere</l>
                    <l>He rules a moment: Chaos umpire sits,</l>
                    <l>And by decision more embroils the fray</l>
                    <l>By which he reigns: next him, high arbiter,</l>
                    <l>Chance governs all. Into this wild Abyss,</l>
                    <l>The womb of Nature, and perhaps her grave,</l>
                    <l>Of neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire,</l>
                    <l>But all these in their pregnant causes mixed</l>
                    <l>Confusedly, and which thus must ever fight,</l>
                    <l>Unless th’ Almighty Maker them ordain</l>
                    <l>His dark materials to create more worlds—</l>
                    <l>Into this wild Abyss the wary Fiend</l>
                    <l>Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while,</l>
                    <l>Pondering his voyage; for no narrow frith</l>
                    <l>He had to cross. Nor was his ear less pealed</l>
                    <l>With noises loud and ruinous (to compare</l>
                    <l>Great things with small) than when Bellona storms</l>
                    <l>With all her battering engines, bent to rase</l>
                    <l>Some capital city; or less than if this frame</l>
                    <l>Of Heaven were falling, and these elements</l>
                    <l>In mutiny had from her axle torn</l>
                    <l>The steadfast Earth. At last his sail-broad vans</l>
                    <l>He spread for flight, and, in the surging smoke</l>
                    <l>Uplifted, spurns the ground; thence many a league,</l>
                    <l>As in a cloudy chair, ascending rides</l>
                    <l>Audacious; but, that seat soon failing, meets</l>
                    <l>A vast vacuity. All unawares,</l>
                    <l>Fluttering his pennons vain, plumb-down he drops</l>
                    <l>Ten thousand fathom deep, and to this hour</l>
                    <l>Down had been falling, had not, by ill chance,</l>
                    <l>The strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud,</l>
                    <l>Instinct with fire and nitre, hurried him</l>
                    <l>As many miles aloft. That fury stayed—</l>
                    <l>Quenched in a boggy Syrtis, neither sea,</l>
                    <l>Nor good dry land—nigh foundered, on he fares,</l>
                    <l>Treading the crude consistence, half on foot,</l>
                    <l>Half flying; behoves him now both oar and sail.</l>
                    <l>As when a gryphon through the wilderness</l>
                    <l>With winged course, o’er hill or moory dale,</l>
                    <l>Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stealth</l>
                    <l>Had from his wakeful custody purloined</l>
                    <l>The guarded gold; so eagerly the Fiend</l>
                    <l>O’er bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,</l>
                    <l>With head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way,</l>
                    <l>And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.</l>
                    <l>At length a universal hubbub wild</l>
                    <l>Of stunning sounds, and voices all confused,</l>
                    <l>Borne through the hollow dark, assaults his ear</l>
                    <l>With loudest vehemence. Thither he plies</l>
                    <l>Undaunted, to meet there whatever Power</l>
                    <l>Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss</l>
                    <l>Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask</l>
                    <l>Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies</l>
                    <l>Bordering on light; when straight behold the throne</l>
                    <l>Of Chaos, and his dark pavilion spread</l>
                    <l>Wide on the wasteful Deep! With him enthroned</l>
                    <l>Sat sable-vested Night, eldest of things,</l>
                    <l>The consort of his reign; and by them stood</l>
                    <l>Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name</l>
                    <l>Of Demogorgon; Rumour next, and Chance,</l>
                    <l>And Tumult, and Confusion, all embroiled,</l>
                    <l>And Discord with a thousand various mouths.</l>

                    <l>And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss,</l>
                    <l>Chaos and ancient Night, I come no spy</l>
                    <l>With purpose to explore or to disturb</l>
                    <l>The secrets of your realm; but, by constraint</l>
                    <l>Wandering this darksome desert, as my way</l>
                    <l>Lies through your spacious empire up to light,</l>
                    <l>Alone and without guide, half lost, I seek,</l>
                    <l>What readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds</l>
                    <l>Confine with Heaven; or, if some other place,</l>
                    <l>From your dominion won, th’ Ethereal King</l>
                    <l>Possesses lately, thither to arrive</l>
                    <l>I travel this profound. Direct my course:</l>
                    <l>Directed, no mean recompense it brings</l>
                    <l>To your behoof, if I that region lost,</l>
                    <l>All usurpation thence expelled, reduce</l>
                    <l>To her original darkness and your sway</l>
                    <l>(Which is my present journey), and once more</l>
                    <l>Erect the standard there of ancient Night.</l>

                    <l>Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old,</l>
                    <l>With faltering speech and visage incomposed,</l>
                    <l>Answered: “I know thee, stranger, who thou art—</l>
                    <l>That mighty leading Angel, who of late</l>
                    <l>Made head against Heaven’s King, though overthrown.</l>

                    <l>Fled not in silence through the frighted Deep,</l>
                    <l>With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,</l>
                    <l>Confusion worse confounded; and Heaven-gates</l>
                    <l>Poured out by millions her victorious bands,</l>
                    <l>Pursuing. I upon my frontiers here</l>

                    <l>That little which is left so to defend,</l>
                    <l>Encroached on still through our intestine broils</l>
                    <l>Weakening the sceptre of old Night: first, Hell,</l>
                    <l>Your dungeon, stretching far and wide beneath;</l>

                    <l>To that side Heaven from whence your legions fell!</l>
                    <l>If that way be your walk, you have not far;</l>
                    <l>So much the nearer danger. Go, and speed;</l>
                    <l>Havoc, and spoil, and ruin, are my gain.”</l>

                    <l>He ceased; and Satan stayed not to reply,</l>
                    <l>But, glad that now his sea should find a shore,</l>
                    <l>With fresh alacrity and force renewed</l>
                    <l>Springs upward, like a pyramid of fire,</l>
                    <l>Into the wild expanse, and through the shock</l>
                    <l>Of fighting elements, on all sides round</l>
                    <l>Environed, wins his way; harder beset</l>
                    <l>And more endangered than when Argo passed</l>
                    <l>Through Bosporus betwixt the justling rocks,</l>
                    <l>Or when Ulysses on the larboard shunned</l>
                    <l>Charybdis, and by th’ other whirlpool steered.</l>
                    <l>So he with difficulty and labour hard</l>
                    <l>Moved on, with difficulty and labour he;</l>
                    <l>But, he once passed, soon after, when Man fell,</l>
                    <l>Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain,</l>
                    <l>Following his track (such was the will of Heaven)</l>
                    <l>Paved after him a broad and beaten way</l>
                    <l>Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling gulf</l>
                    <l>Tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length,</l>
                    <l>From Hell continued, reaching th’ utmost orb</l>
                    <l>Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse</l>
                    <l>With easy intercourse pass to and fro</l>
                    <l>To tempt or punish mortals, except whom</l>

                    <l>Of light appears, and from the walls of Heaven</l>
                    <l>Shoots far into the bosom of dim Night</l>
                    <l>A glimmering dawn. Here Nature first begins</l>
                    <l>Her farthest verge, and Chaos to retire,</l>
                    <l>As from her outmost works, a broken foe,</l>
                    <l>With tumult less and with less hostile din;</l>
                    <l>That Satan with less toil, and now with ease,</l>
                    <l>Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light,</l>
                    <l>And, like a weather-beaten vessel, holds</l>
                    <l>Gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn;</l>
                    <l>Or in the emptier waste, resembling air,</l>
                    <l>Weighs his spread wings, at leisure to behold</l>
                    <l>Far off th’ empyreal Heaven, extended wide</l>
                    <l>In circuit, undetermined square or round,</l>
                    <l>With opal towers and battlements adorned</l>
                    <l>Of living sapphire, once his native seat;</l>
                    <l>And, fast by, hanging in a golden chain,</l>
                    <l>This pendent World, in bigness as a star</l>
                    <l>Of smallest magnitude close by the moon.</l>
                    <l>Thither, full fraught with mischievous revenge,</l>
                    <l>Accursed, and in a cursed hour, he hies.</l>

                    <l>May I express thee unblam’d? since God is light,</l>

                    <l>Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down</l>
                    <l>The dark descent, and up to re-ascend,</l>
                    <l>Though hard and rare: Thee I revisit safe,</l>
                    <l>And feel thy sovran vital lamp; but thou</l>
                    <l>Revisit’st not these eyes, that roll in vain</l>
                    <l>To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;</l>
                    <l>So thick a drop serene hath quench’d their orbs,</l>
                    <l>Or dim suffusion veil’d. Yet not the more</l>
                    <l>Cease I to wander, where the Muses haunt,</l>
                    <l>Clear spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill,</l>
                    <l>Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief</l>
                    <l>Thee, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath,</l>
                    <l>That wash thy hallow’d feet, and warbling flow,</l>
                    <l>Nightly I visit: nor sometimes forget</l>
                    <l>Those other two equaled with me in fate</l>
                    <l>So were I equall’d with them in renown,</l>
                    <l>Thy sovran command, that Man should find grace;</l>
                    <l>Blind Thamyris, and blind Maeonides,</l>
                    <l>And Tiresias, and Phineus, prophets old:</l>
                    <l>Then feed on thoughts, that voluntary move</l>
                    <l>Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful bird</l>
                    <l>Sings darkling, and in shadiest covert hid</l>
                    <l>Tunes her nocturnal note. Thus with the year</l>
                    <l>Seasons return; but not to me returns</l>
                    <l>Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn,</l>
                    <l>Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer’s rose,</l>
                    <l>Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;</l>
                    <l>But cloud instead, and ever-during dark</l>
                    <l>Surrounds me, from the cheerful ways of men</l>
                    <l>Cut off, and for the book of knowledge fair</l>
                    <l>Presented with a universal blank</l>
                    <l>Of nature’s works to me expung’d and ras’d,</l>
                    <l>And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.</l>
                    <l>So much the rather thou, celestial Light,</l>
                    <l>Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers</l>
                    <l>Irradiate; there plant eyes, all mist from thence</l>
                    <l>Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell</l>
                    <l>Of things invisible to mortal sight.</l>
                    <l>Now had the Almighty Father from above,</l>
                    <l>From the pure empyrean where he sits</l>
                    <l>High thron’d above all highth, bent down his eye</l>
                    <l>His own works and their works at once to view:</l>
                    <l>About him all the Sanctities of Heaven</l>
                    <l>Stood thick as stars, and from his sight receiv’d</l>
                    <l>Beatitude past utterance; on his right</l>
                    <l>The radiant image of his glory sat,</l>
                    <l>His only son; on earth he first beheld</l>
                    <l>Our two first parents, yet the only two</l>
                    <l>Of mankind in the happy garden plac’d</l>
                    <l>Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love,</l>
                    <l>Uninterrupted joy, unrivall’d love,</l>
                    <l>In blissful solitude; he then survey’d</l>
                    <l>Hell and the gulf between, and Satan there</l>
                    <l>Coasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night</l>
                    <l>In the dun air sublime, and ready now</l>
                    <l>To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet,</l>
                    <l>On the bare outside of this world, that seem’d</l>
                    <l>Firm land imbosom’d, without firmament,</l>
                    <l>Uncertain which, in ocean or in air.</l>
                    <l>Him God beholding from his prospect high,</l>
                    <l>Wherein past, present, future, he beholds,</l>
                    <l>Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake.</l>
                    <l>Only begotten Son, seest thou what rage</l>
                    <l>Transports our Adversary? whom no bounds</l>
                    <l>Prescrib’d no bars of Hell, nor all the chains</l>
                    <l>Heap’d on him there, nor yet the main abyss</l>
                    <l>Wide interrupt, can hold; so bent he seems</l>
                    <l>On desperate revenge, that shall redound</l>
                    <l>Upon his own rebellious head. And now,</l>
                    <l>Through all restraint broke loose, he wings his way</l>
                    <l>Not far off Heaven, in the precincts of light,</l>
                    <l>Directly towards the new created world,</l>
                    <l>And man there plac’d, with purpose to assay</l>
                    <l>If him by force he can destroy, or, worse,</l>
                    <l>By some false guile pervert; and shall pervert;</l>
                    <l>For man will hearken to his glozing lies,</l>
                    <l>And easily transgress the sole command,</l>
                    <l>Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall</l>
                    <l>He and his faithless progeny: Whose fault?</l>
                    <l>Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of me</l>
                    <l>All he could have; I made him just and right,</l>
                    <l>Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.</l>
                    <l>Such I created all the ethereal Powers</l>
                    <l>And Spirits, both them who stood, and them who fail’d;</l>
                    <l>Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell.</l>
                    <l>Not free, what proof could they have given sincere</l>
                    <l>Of true allegiance, constant faith or love,</l>
                    <l>Where only what they needs must do appear’d,</l>
                    <l>Not what they would? what praise could they receive?</l>
                    <l>What pleasure I from such obedience paid,</l>
                    <l>When will and reason (reason also is choice)</l>
                    <l>Useless and vain, of freedom both despoil’d,</l>
                    <l>Made passive both, had serv’d necessity,</l>
                    <l>Not me. They therefore, as to right belong’d,</l>
                    <l>So were created, nor can justly accuse</l>
                    <l>Their Maker, or their making, or their fate,</l>
                    <l>As if predestination over-rul’d</l>
                    <l>Their will dispos’d by absolute decree</l>
                    <l>Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed</l>
                    <l>Their own revolt, not I; if I foreknew,</l>
                    <l>Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault,</l>
                    <l>Which had no less proved certain unforeknown.</l>
                    <l>So without least impulse or shadow of fate,</l>
                    <l>Or aught by me immutably foreseen,</l>
                    <l>They trespass, authors to themselves in all</l>
                    <l>Both what they judge, and what they choose; for so</l>
                    <l>I form’d them free: and free they must remain,</l>
                    <l>Till they enthrall themselves; I else must change</l>
                    <l>Their nature, and revoke the high decree</l>
                    <l>Unchangeable, eternal, which ordain’d</l>
                    <l>Their freedom: they themselves ordain’d their fall.</l>
                    <l>The first sort by their own suggestion fell,</l>
                    <l>Self-tempted, self-deprav’d: Man falls, deceiv’d</l>
                    <l>By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace,</l>
                    <l>The other none: In mercy and justice both,</l>
                    <l>Through Heaven and Earth, so shall my glory excel;</l>
                    <l>But Mercy, first and last, shall brightest shine.</l>
                    <l>Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill’d</l>
                    <l>All Heaven, and in the blessed Spirits elect</l>
                    <l>Sense of new joy ineffable diffus’d.</l>
                    <l>Beyond compare the Son of God was seen</l>
                    <l>Most glorious; in him all his Father shone</l>
                    <l>Substantially express’d; and in his face</l>
                    <l>Divine compassion visibly appear’d,</l>
                    <l>Love without end, and without measure grace,</l>
                    <l>Which uttering, thus he to his Father spake.</l>
                    <l>O Father, gracious was that word which clos’d</l>
                    <l>Thy sovran command, that Man should find grace;</l>
                    <l>For which both Heaven and earth shall high extol</l>
                    <l>Thy praises, with the innumerable sound</l>
                    <l>Of hymns and sacred songs, wherewith thy throne</l>
                    <l>Encompass’d shall resound thee ever blest.</l>
                    <l>For should Man finally be lost, should Man,</l>
                    <l>Thy creature late so lov’d, thy youngest son,</l>
                    <l>Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though join’d</l>
                    <l>With his own folly? that be from thee far,</l>
                    <l>That far be from thee, Father, who art judge</l>
                    <l>Of all things made, and judgest only right.</l>
                    <l>Or shall the Adversary thus obtain</l>
                    <l>His end, and frustrate thine? shall he fulfill</l>
                    <l>His malice, and thy goodness bring to nought,</l>
                    <l>Or proud return, though to his heavier doom,</l>
                    <l>Yet with revenge accomplish’d, and to Hell</l>
                    <l>Draw after him the whole race of mankind,</l>
                    <l>By him corrupted? or wilt thou thyself</l>
                    <l>Abolish thy creation, and unmake</l>
                    <l>For him, what for thy glory thou hast made?</l>
                    <l>So should thy goodness and thy greatness both</l>
                    <l>Be question’d and blasphem’d without defence.</l>
                    <l>To whom the great Creator thus replied.</l>
                    <l>O son, in whom my soul hath chief delight,</l>
                    <l>Son of my bosom, Son who art alone.</l>
                    <l>My word, my wisdom, and effectual might,</l>
                    <l>All hast thou spoken as my thoughts are, all</l>
                    <l>As my eternal purpose hath decreed;</l>
                    <l>Man shall not quite be lost, but sav’d who will;</l>
                    <l>Yet not of will in him, but grace in me</l>
                    <l>Freely vouchsaf’d; once more I will renew</l>
                    <l>His lapsed powers, though forfeit; and enthrall’d</l>
                    <l>By sin to foul exorbitant desires;</l>
                    <l>Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand</l>
                    <l>On even ground against his mortal foe;</l>
                    <l>By me upheld, that he may know how frail</l>
                    <l>His fallen condition is, and to me owe</l>
                    <l>All his deliverance, and to none but me.</l>
                    <l>Some I have chosen of peculiar grace,</l>
                    <l>Elect above the rest; so is my will:</l>
                    <l>The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warn’d</l>
                    <l>Their sinful state, and to appease betimes</l>
                    <l>The incensed Deity, while offer’d grace</l>
                    <l>Invites; for I will clear their senses dark,</l>
                    <l>What may suffice, and soften stony hearts</l>
                    <l>To pray, repent, and bring obedience due.</l>
                    <l>To prayer, repentance, and obedience due,</l>
                    <l>Though but endeavour’d with sincere intent,</l>
                    <l>Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut.</l>
                    <l>And I will place within them as a guide,</l>
                    <l>My umpire Conscience; whom if they will hear,</l>
                    <l>Light after light, well us’d, they shall attain,</l>
                    <l>And to the end, persisting, safe arrive.</l>
                    <l>This my long sufferance, and my day of grace,</l>
                    <l>They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste;</l>
                    <l>But hard be harden’d, blind be blinded more,</l>
                    <l>That they may stumble on, and deeper fall;</l>
                    <l>And none but such from mercy I exclude.</l>
                    <l>But yet all is not done; Man disobeying,</l>
                    <l>Disloyal, breaks his fealty, and sins</l>
                    <l>Against the high supremacy of Heaven,</l>
                    <l>Affecting God-head, and, so losing all,</l>
                    <l>To expiate his treason hath nought left,</l>
                    <l>But to destruction sacred and devote,</l>
                    <l>He, with his whole posterity, must die,</l>
                    <l>Die he or justice must; unless for him</l>
                    <l>Some other able, and as willing, pay</l>
                    <l>The rigid satisfaction, death for death.</l>
                    <l>Say, heavenly Powers, where shall we find such love?</l>
                    <l>Which of you will be mortal, to redeem</l>
                    <l>Man’s mortal crime, and just the unjust to save?</l>
                    <l>Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear?</l>
                    <l>He ask’d, but all the heavenly quire stood mute,</l>
                    <l>And silence was in Heaven: on Man’s behalf</l>
                    <l>Patron or intercessour none appear’d,</l>
                    <l>Much less that durst upon his own head draw</l>
                    <l>The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.</l>
                    <l>And now without redemption all mankind</l>
                    <l>Must have been lost, adjudg’d to Death and Hell</l>
                    <l>By doom severe, had not the Son of God,</l>
                    <l>In whom the fulness dwells of love divine,</l>
                    <l>His dearest mediation thus renew’d.</l>
                    <l>Father, thy word is past, Man shall find grace;</l>
                    <l>And shall grace not find means, that finds her way,</l>
                    <l>The speediest of thy winged messengers,</l>
                    <l>To visit all thy creatures, and to all</l>
                    <l>Comes unprevented, unimplor’d, unsought?</l>
                    <l>Happy for Man, so coming; he her aid</l>
                    <l>Can never seek, once dead in sins, and lost;</l>
                    <l>Atonement for himself, or offering meet,</l>
                    <l>Indebted and undone, hath none to bring;</l>
                    <l>Behold me then: me for him, life for life</l>
                    <l>I offer: on me let thine anger fall;</l>
                    <l>Account me Man; I for his sake will leave</l>
                    <l>Thy bosom, and this glory next to thee</l>
                    <l>Freely put off, and for him lastly die</l>
                    <l>Well pleased; on me let Death wreak all his rage.</l>
                    <l>Under his gloomy power I shall not long</l>
                    <l>Lie vanquished. Thou hast given me to possess</l>
                    <l>Life in myself for ever; by thee I live;</l>
                    <l>Though now to Death I yield, and am his due,</l>
                    <l>All that of me can die, yet, that debt paid,</l>
                    <l>Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave</l>
                    <l>His prey, nor suffer my unspotted soul</l>
                    <l>For ever with corruption there to dwell;</l>
                    <l>But I shall rise victorious, and subdue</l>
                    <l>My vanquisher, spoiled of his vaunted spoil.</l>
                    <l>Death his death’s wound shall then receive, and stoop</l>
                    <l>Inglorious, of his mortal sting disarmed;</l>
                    <l>I through the ample air in triumph high</l>
                    <l>Shall lead Hell captive maugre Hell, and show</l>
                    <l>The powers of darkness bound. Thou, at the sight</l>
                    <l>Pleased, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile,</l>
                    <l>While, by thee raised, I ruin all my foes;</l>
                    <l>Death last, and with his carcase glut the grave;</l>
                    <l>Then, with the multitude of my redeemed,</l>
                    <l>Shall enter Heaven, long absent, and return,</l>
                    <l>Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud</l>
                    <l>Of anger shall remain, but peace assured</l>
                    <l>And reconcilement: wrath shall be no more</l>
                    <l>Thenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire.</l>
                </lg>
            </p>
            <p>
                <lg>
                    <l>His words here ended; but his meek aspect</l>
                    <l>Silent yet spake, and breathed immortal love</l>
                    <l>To mortal men, above which only shone</l>
                    <l>Filial obedience: as a sacrifice</l>
                    <l>Glad to be offered, he attends the will</l>
                    <l>Of his great Father. Admiration seized</l>
                    <l>All Heaven, what this might mean, and whither tend,</l>
                    <l>Wondering; but soon th’ Almighty thus replied:</l>
                </lg>
            </p>
            <p>
                <lg>
                    <l>O thou in Heaven and Earth the only peace</l>
                    <l>Found out for mankind under wrath, O thou</l>
                    <l>My sole complacence! Well thou know’st how dear</l>
                    <l>To me are all my works; nor Man the least,</l>
                    <l>Though last created, that for him I spare</l>
                    <l>Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save,</l>
                    <l>By losing thee a while, the whole race lost.</l>
                    <l>Thou, therefore, whom thou only canst redeem,</l>
                    <l>Their nature also to thy nature join;</l>
                    <l>And be thyself Man among men on Earth,</l>
                    <l>Made flesh, when time shall be, of virgin seed,</l>
                    <l>By wondrous birth; be thou in Adam’s room</l>
                    <l>The head of all mankind, though Adam’s son.</l>
                    <l>As in him perish all men, so in thee,</l>
                    <l>As from a second root, shall be restored</l>
                    <l>As many as are restored, without thee none.</l>
                    <l>His crime makes guilty all his sons; thy merit,</l>
                    <l>Imputed, shall absolve them who renounce</l>
                    <l>Their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds,</l>
                    <l>And live in thee transplanted, and from thee</l>
                    <l>Receive new life. So Man, as is most just,</l>
                    <l>Shall satisfy for Man, be judged and die,</l>
                    <l>And dying rise, and rising with him raise</l>
                    <l>His brethren, ransomed with his own dear life.</l>
                    <l>So heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate,</l>
                    <l>Giving to death, and dying to redeem,</l>
                    <l>So dearly to redeem what hellish hate</l>
                    <l>So easily destroyed, and still destroys</l>
                    <l>In those who, when they may, accept not grace.</l>
                    <l>Nor shalt thou, by descending to assume</l>
                    <l>Man’s nature, lessen or degrade thine own.</l>
                    <l>Because thou hast, though throned in highest bliss</l>
                    <l>Equal to God, and equally enjoying</l>
                    <l>God-like fruition, quitted all, to save</l>
                    <l>A world from utter loss, and hast been found</l>
                    <l>By merit more than birthright Son of God,</l>
                    <l>Found worthiest to be so by being good,</l>
                    <l>Far more than great or high; because in thee</l>
                    <l>Love hath abounded more than glory abounds;</l>
                    <l>Therefore thy humiliation shall exalt</l>
                    <l>With thee thy manhood also to this throne:</l>
                    <l>Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt reign</l>
                    <l>Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man,</l>
                    <l>Anointed universal King; all power</l>
                    <l>I give thee; reign for ever, and assume</l>
                    <l>Thy merits; under thee, as head supreme,</l>
                    <l>Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions, I reduce:</l>
                    <l>All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide</l>
                    <l>In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell.</l>
                    <l>When thou, attended gloriously from Heaven,</l>
                    <l>Shalt in the sky appear, and from thee send</l>
                    <l>The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaim</l>
                    <l>Thy dread tribunal; forthwith from all winds,</l>
                    <l>The living, and forthwith the cited dead</l>
                    <l>Of all past ages, to the general doom</l>
                    <l>Shall hasten; such a peal shall rouse their sleep.</l>
                    <l>Then, all thy saints assembled, thou shalt judge</l>
                    <l>Bad Men and Angels; they, arraigned, shall sink</l>
                    <l>Beneath thy sentence; Hell, her numbers full,</l>
                    <l>Thenceforth shall be for ever shut. Mean while</l>
                    <l>The world shall burn, and from her ashes spring</l>
                    <l>New Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell,</l>
                    <l>And, after all their tribulations long,</l>
                    <l>See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds,</l>
                    <l>With joy and peace triumphing, and fair truth.</l>
                    <l>Then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by,</l>
                    <l>For regal scepter then no more shall need,</l>
                    <l>God shall be all in all. But, all ye Gods,</l>
                    <l>Adore him, who to compass all this dies;</l>
                    <l>Adore the Son, and honour him as me.</l>
                    <l>No sooner had the Almighty ceased, but all</l>
                    <l>The multitude of Angels, with a shout</l>
                    <l>Loud as from numbers without number, sweet</l>
                    <l>As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heaven rung</l>
                    <l>With jubilee, and loud Hosannas filled</l>
                    <l>The eternal regions: Lowly reverent</l>
                    <l>Towards either throne they bow, and to the ground</l>
                    <l>With solemn adoration down they cast</l>
                    <l>Their crowns inwove with amarant and gold;</l>
                    <l>Immortal amarant, a flower which once</l>
                    <l>In Paradise, fast by the tree of life,</l>
                    <l>Began to bloom; but soon for man’s offence</l>
                    <l>To Heaven removed, where first it grew, there grows,</l>
                    <l>And flowers aloft shading the fount of life,</l>
                    <l>And where the river of bliss through midst of Heaven</l>
                    <l>Rolls o’er Elysian flowers her amber stream;</l>
                    <l>With these that never fade the Spirits elect</l>
                    <l>Bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams;</l>
                    <l>Now in loose garlands thick thrown off, the bright</l>
                    <l>Pavement, that like a sea of jasper shone,</l>
                    <l>Impurpled with celestial roses smiled.</l>
                    <l>Then, crowned again, their golden harps they took,</l>
                    <l>Harps ever tuned, that glittering by their side</l>
                    <l>Like quivers hung, and with preamble sweet</l>
                    <l>Of charming symphony they introduce</l>
                    <l>Their sacred song, and waken raptures high;</l>
                    <l>No voice exempt, no voice but well could join</l>
                    <l>Melodious part, such concord is in Heaven.</l>
                    <l>Thee, Father, first they sung Omnipotent,</l>
                    <l>Immutable, Immortal, Infinite,</l>
                    <l>Eternal King; the Author of all being,</l>
                    <l>Fountain of light, thyself invisible</l>
                    <l>Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit’st</l>
                    <l>Throned inaccessible, but when thou shadest</l>
                    <l>The full blaze of thy beams, and, through a cloud</l>
                    <l>Drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine,</l>
                    <l>Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear,</l>
                    <l>Yet dazzle Heaven, that brightest Seraphim</l>
                    <l>Approach not, but with both wings veil their eyes.</l>
                    <l>Thee next they sang of all creation first,</l>
                    <l>Begotten Son, Divine Similitude,</l>
                    <l>In whose conspicuous countenance, without cloud</l>
                    <l>Made visible, the Almighty Father shines,</l>
                    <l>Whom else no creature can behold; on thee</l>
                    <l>Impressed the effulgence of his glory abides,</l>
                    <l>Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests.</l>
                    <l>He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein</l>
                    <l>By thee created; and by thee threw down</l>
                    <l>The aspiring Dominations: Thou that day</l>
                    <l>Thy Father’s dreadful thunder didst not spare,</l>
                    <l>Nor stop thy flaming chariot-wheels, that shook</l>
                    <l>Heaven’s everlasting frame, while o’er the necks</l>
                    <l>Thou drovest of warring Angels disarrayed.</l>
                    <l>Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaim</l>
                    <l>Thee only extolled, Son of thy Father’s might,</l>
                    <l>To execute fierce vengeance on his foes,</l>
                    <l>Not so on Man: Him through their malice fallen,</l>
                    <l>Father of mercy and grace, thou didst not doom</l>
                    <l>So strictly, but much more to pity incline:</l>
                    <l>No sooner did thy dear and only Son</l>
                    <l>Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man</l>
                    <l>So strictly, but much more to pity inclined,</l>
                    <l>He to appease thy wrath, and end the strife</l>
                    <l>Of mercy and justice in thy face discerned,</l>
                    <l>Regardless of the bliss wherein he sat</l>
                    <l>Second to thee, offered himself to die</l>
                    <l>For Man’s offence. O unexampled love,</l>
                    <l>Love no where to be found less than Divine!</l>
                    <l>Hail, Son of God, Saviour of Men! Thy name</l>
                    <l>Shall be the copious matter of my song</l>
                    <l>Henceforth, and never shall my heart thy praise</l>
                    <l>Forget, nor from thy Father’s praise disjoin.</l>
                    <l>Thus they in Heaven, above the starry sphere,</l>
                    <l>Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent.</l>
                    <l>Mean while upon the firm opacous globe</l>
                    <l>Of this round world, whose first convex divides</l>
                    <l>The luminous inferiour orbs, enclosed</l>
                    <l>From Chaos, and the inroad of Darkness old,</l>
                    <l>Satan alighted walks: A globe far off</l>
                    <l>It seemed, now seems a boundless continent</l>
                    <l>Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night</l>
                    <l>Starless exposed, and ever-threatening storms</l>
                    <l>Of Chaos blustering round, inclement sky;</l>
                    <l>Save on that side which from the wall of Heaven,</l>
                    <l>Though distant far, some small reflection gains</l>
                    <l>Of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud:</l>
                    <l>Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field.</l>
                    <l>As when a vultur on Imaus bred,</l>
                    <l>Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds,</l>
                    <l>Dislodging from a region scarce of prey</l>
                    <l>To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids,</l>
                    <l>On hills where flocks are fed, flies toward the springs</l>
                    <l>Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams;</l>
                    <l>But in his way lights on the barren plains</l>
                    <l>Of Sericana, where Chineses drive</l>
                    <l>With sails and wind their cany waggons light:</l>
                    <l>So, on this windy sea of land, the Fiend</l>
                    <l>Walked up and down alone, bent on his prey;</l>
                    <l>Alone, for other creature in this place,</l>
                    <l>Living or lifeless, to be found was none;</l>
                    <l>None yet, but store hereafter from the earth</l>
                    <l>Up hither like aereal vapours flew</l>
                    <l>Of all things transitory and vain, when sin</l>
                    <l>With vanity had filled the works of men:</l>
                    <l>Both all things vain, and all who in vain things</l>
                    <l>Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame,</l>
                    <l>Or happiness in this or the other life;</l>
                    <l>All who have their reward on earth, the fruits</l>
                    <l>Of painful superstition and blind zeal,</l>
                    <l>Nought seeking but the praise of men, here find</l>
                    <l>Fit retribution, empty as their deeds;</l>
                    <l>All the unaccomplished works of Nature’s hand,</l>
                    <l>Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixed,</l>
                    <l>Dissolved on earth, fleet hither, and in vain,</l>
                    <l>Till final dissolution, wander here;</l>
                    <l>Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed;</l>
                    <l>Those argent fields more likely habitants,</l>
                    <l>Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold</l>
                    <l>Betwixt the angelical and human kind.</l>
                    <l>Hither of ill-joined sons and daughters born</l>
                    <l>First from the ancient world those giants came</l>
                    <l>With many a vain exploit, though then renowned:</l>
                    <l>The builders next of Babel on the plain</l>
                    <l>Of Sennaar, and still with vain design,</l>
                    <l>New Babels, had they wherewithal, would build:</l>
                    <l>Others came single; he, who, to be deemed</l>
                    <l>A God, leaped fondly into Aetna flames,</l>
                    <l>Empedocles; and he, who, to enjoy</l>
                    <l>Plato’s Elysium, leaped into the sea,</l>
                    <l>Cleombrotus; and many more too long,</l>
                    <l>Embryos, and idiots, eremites, and friars</l>
                    <l>White, black, and gray, with all their trumpery.</l>
                    <l>Here pilgrims roam, that strayed so far to seek</l>
                    <l>In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heaven;</l>
                    <l>And they, who to be sure of Paradise,</l>
                    <l>Dying, put on the weeds of Dominick,</l>
                    <l>Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised;</l>
                    <l>They pass the planets seven, and pass the fixed,</l>
                    <l>And that crystalline sphere whose balance weighs</l>
                    <l>The trepidation talked, and that first moved;</l>
                    <l>And now Saint Peter at Heaven’s wicket seems</l>
                    <l>To wait them with his keys, and now at foot</l>
                    <l>Of Heaven’s ascent they lift their feet, when lo</l>
                    <l>A violent cross wind from either coast</l>
                    <l>Blows them transverse, ten thousand leagues awry</l>
                    <l>Into the devious air: Then might ye see</l>
                    <l>Cowls, hoods, and habits, with their wearers, tost</l>
                    <l>And fluttered into rags; then reliques, beads,</l>
                    <l>Indulgences, dispenses, pardons, bulls,</l>
                    <l>The sport of winds: All these, upwhirled aloft,</l>
                    <l>Fly o’er the backside of the world far off</l>
                    <l>Into a Limbo large and broad, since called</l>
                    <l>The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown</l>
                    <l>Long after; now unpeopled, and untrod.</l>
                    <l>All this dark globe the Fiend found as he passed,</l>
                    <l>And long he wandered, till at last a gleam</l>
                    <l>Of dawning light turned thither-ward in haste</l>
                    <l>His travelled steps: far distant he descries</l>
                    <l>Ascending by degrees magnificent</l>
                    <l>Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high;</l>
                    <l>At top whereof, but far more rich, appeared</l>
                    <l>The work as of a kingly palace-gate,</l>
                    <l>With frontispiece of diamond and gold</l>
                    <l>Embellished; thick with sparkling orient gems</l>
                    <l>The portal shone, inimitable on earth</l>
                    <l>By model, or by shading pencil, drawn.</l>
                    <l>These stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw</l>
                    <l>Angels ascending and descending, bands</l>
                    <l>Of guardians bright, when he from Esau fled</l>
                    <l>To Padan-Aram, in the field of Luz</l>
                    <l>Dreaming by night under the open sky</l>
                    <l>And waking cried, This is the gate of Heaven.</l>
                    <l>Each stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood</l>
                    <l>There always, but drawn up to Heaven sometimes</l>
                    <l>Viewless; and underneath a bright sea flowed</l>
                    <l>Of jasper, or of liquid pearl, whereon</l>
                    <l>Who after came from earth, failing arrived</l>
                    <l>Wafted by Angels, or flew o’er the lake</l>
                    <l>Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds.</l>
                    <l>The stairs were then let down, whether to dare</l>
                    <l>The Fiend by easy ascent, or aggravate</l>
                    <l>His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss:</l>
                    <l>Direct against which opened from beneath,</l>
                    <l>Just o’er the blissful seat of Paradise,</l>
                    <l>A passage down to the Earth, a passage wide,</l>
                    <l>Wider by far than that of after-times</l>
                    <l>Over mount Sion, and, though that were large,</l>
                    <l>Over the Promised Land to God so dear;</l>
                    <l>By which, to visit oft those happy tribes,</l>
                    <l>On high behests his angels to and fro</l>
                    <l>Passed frequent, and his eye with choice regard</l>
                    <l>From Paneas, the fount of Jordan’s flood,</l>
                    <l>To Beersaba, where the Holy Land</l>
                    <l>Borders on Egypt and the Arabian shore;</l>
                    <l>So wide the opening seemed, where bounds were set</l>
                    <l>To darkness, such as bound the ocean wave.</l>
                    <l>Satan from hence, now on the lower stair,</l>
                    <l>That scaled by steps of gold to Heaven-gate,</l>
                    <l>Looks down with wonder at the sudden view</l>
                    <l>Of all this world at once. As when a scout,</l>
                    <l>Through dark and desert ways with peril gone</l>
                    <l>All night; at last by break of cheerful dawn</l>
                    <l>Obtains the brow of some high-climbing hill,</l>
                    <l>Which to his eye discovers unaware</l>
                    <l>The goodly prospect of some foreign land</l>
                    <l>First seen, or some renowned metropolis</l>
                    <l>With glistering spires and pinnacles adorned,</l>
                    <l>Which now the rising sun gilds with his beams:</l>
                    <l>Such wonder seised, though after Heaven seen,</l>
                    <l>The Spirit malign, but much more envy seised,</l>
                    <l>At sight of all this world beheld so fair.</l>
                    <l>Round he surveys (and well might, where he stood</l>
                    <l>So high above the circling canopy</l>
                    <l>Of night’s extended shade,) from eastern point</l>
                    <l>Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears</l>
                    <l>Andromeda far off Atlantick seas</l>
                    <l>Beyond the horizon; then from pole to pole</l>
                    <l>He views in breadth, and without longer pause</l>
                    <l>Down right into the world’s first region throws</l>
                    <l>His flight precipitant, and winds with ease</l>
                    <l>Through the pure marble air his oblique way</l>
                    <l>Amongst innumerable stars, that shone</l>
                    <l>Stars distant, but nigh hand seemed other worlds;</l>
                    <l>Or other worlds they seemed, or happy isles,</l>
                    <l>Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old,</l>
                    <l>Fortunate fields, and groves, and flowery vales,</l>
                    <l>Thrice happy isles; but who dwelt happy there</l>
                    <l>He staid not to inquire: Above them all</l>
                    <l>The golden sun, in splendour likest Heaven,</l>
                    <l>Allured his eye; thither his course he bends</l>
                    <l>Through the calm firmament, (but up or down,</l>
                    <l>By center, or eccentrick, hard to tell,</l>
                    <l>Or longitude,) where the great luminary</l>
                    <l>Aloof the vulgar constellations thick,</l>
                    <l>That from his lordly eye keep distance due,</l>
                    <l>Dispenses light from far; they, as they move</l>
                    <l>Their starry dance in numbers that compute</l>
                    <l>Days, months, and years, towards his all-cheering lamp</l>
                    <l>Turn swift their various motions, or are turned</l>
                    <l>By his magnetick beam, that gently warms</l>
                    <l>The universe, and to each inward part</l>
                    <l>With gentle penetration, though unseen,</l>
                    <l>Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep;</l>
                    <l>So wonderously was set his station bright.</l>
                    <l>There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps</l>
                    <l>Astronomer in the sun’s lucent orb</l>
                    <l>Through his glazed optick tube yet never saw.</l>
                    <l>The place he found beyond expression bright,</l>
                    <l>Compared with aught on earth, metal or stone;</l>
                    <l>Not all parts like, but all alike informed</l>
                    <l>With radiant light, as glowing iron with fire;</l>
                    <l>If metal, part seemed gold, part silver clear;</l>
                    <l>If stone, carbuncle most or chrysolite,</l>
                    <l>Ruby or topaz, to the twelve that shone</l>
                    <l>In Aaron’s breast-plate, and a stone besides</l>
                    <l>Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen,</l>
                    <l>That stone, or like to that which here below</l>
                    <l>Philosophers in vain so long have sought,</l>
                    <l>In vain, though by their powerful art they bind</l>
                    <l>Volatile Hermes, and call up unbound</l>
                    <l>In various shapes old Proteus from the sea,</l>
                    <l>Drained through a limbeck to his native form.</l>
                    <l>What wonder then if fields and regions here</l>
                    <l>Breathe forth Elixir pure, and rivers run</l>
                    <l>Potable gold, when with one virtuous touch</l>
                    <l>The arch-chemick sun, so far from us remote,</l>
                    <l>Produces, with terrestrial humour mixed,</l>
                    <l>Here in the dark so many precious things</l>
                    <l>Of colour glorious, and effect so rare?</l>
                    <l>Here matter new to gaze the Devil met</l>
                    <l>Undazzled; far and wide his eye commands;</l>
                    <l>For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,</l>
                    <l>But all sun-shine, as when his beams at noon</l>
                    <l>Culminate from the equator, as they now</l>
                    <l>Shot upward still direct, whence no way round</l>
                    <l>Shadow from body opaque can fall; and the air,</l>
                    <l>No where so clear, sharpened his visual ray</l>
                    <l>To objects distant far, whereby he soon</l>
                    <l>Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand,</l>
                    <l>The same whom John saw also in the sun:</l>
                    <l>His back was turned, but not his brightness hid;</l>
                    <l>Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar</l>
                    <l>Circled his head, nor less his locks behind</l>
                    <l>Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings</l>
                    <l>Lay waving round; on some great charge employed</l>
                    <l>He seemed, or fixed in cogitation deep.</l>
                    <l>Glad was the Spirit impure, as now in hope</l>
                    <l>To find who might direct his wandering flight</l>
                    <l>To Paradise, the happy seat of Man,</l>
                    <l>His journey’s end and our beginning woe.</l>
                    <l>But first he casts to change his proper shape,</l>
                    <l>Which else might work him danger or delay:</l>
                    <l>And now a stripling Cherub he appears,</l>
                    <l>Not of the prime, yet such as in his face</l>
                    <l>Youth smiled celestial, and to every limb</l>
                    <l>Suitable grace diffused, so well he feigned:</l>
                    <l>Under a coronet his flowing hair</l>
                    <l>In curls on either cheek played; wings he wore</l>
                    <l>Of many a coloured plume, sprinkled with gold;</l>
                    <l>His habit fit for speed succinct, and held</l>
                    <l>Before his decent steps a silver wand.</l>
                    <l>He drew not nigh unheard; the Angel bright,</l>
                    <l>Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turned,</l>
                    <l>Admonished by his ear, and straight was known</l>
                    <l>The Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seven</l>
                    <l>Who in God’s presence, nearest to his throne,</l>
                    <l>Stand ready at command, and are his eyes</l>
                    <l>That run through all the Heavens, or down to the Earth</l>
                    <l>Bear his swift errands over moist and dry,</l>
                    <l>O’er sea and land: him Satan thus accosts.</l>
                    <l>Uriel, for thou of those seven Spirits that stand</l>
                    <l>In sight of God’s high throne, gloriously bright,</l>
                    <l>The first art wont his great authentick will</l>
                    <l>Interpreter through highest Heaven to bring,</l>
                    <l>Where all his sons thy embassy attend;</l>
                    <l>And here art likeliest by supreme decree</l>
                    <l>Like honour to obtain, and as his eye</l>
                    <l>To visit oft this new creation round;</l>
                    <l>Unspeakable desire to see, and know</l>
                    <l>All these his wonderous works, but chiefly Man,</l>
                    <l>His chief delight and favour, him for whom</l>
                    <l>All these his works so wonderous he ordained,</l>
                    <l>Hath brought me from the quires of Cherubim</l>
                    <l>Alone thus wandering. Brightest Seraph, tell</l>
                    <l>In which of all these shining orbs hath Man</l>
                    <l>His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none,</l>
                    <l>But all these shining orbs his choice to dwell;</l>
                    <l>That I may find him, and with secret gaze</l>
                    <l>Or open admiration him behold,</l>
                    <l>On whom the great Creator hath bestowed</l>
                    <l>Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces poured;</l>
                    <l>That both in him and all things, as is meet,</l>
                    <l>The universal Maker we may praise;</l>
                    <l>Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes</l>
                    <l>To deepest Hell, and, to repair that loss,</l>
                    <l>Created this new happy race of Men</l>
                    <l>To serve him better: Wise are all his ways.</l>
                    <l>So spake the false dissembler unperceived;</l>
                    <l>For neither Man nor Angel can discern</l>
                    <l>Hypocrisy, the only evil that walks</l>
                    <l>Invisible, except to God alone,</l>
                    <l>By his permissive will, through Heaven and Earth:</l>
                    <l>And oft, though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps</l>
                    <l>At wisdom’s gate, and to simplicity</l>
                    <l>Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill</l>
                    <l>Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguiled</l>
                    <l>Uriel, though regent of the sun, and held</l>
                    <l>The sharpest-sighted Spirit of all in Heaven;</l>
                    <l>Who to the fraudulent impostor foul,</l>
                    <l>In his uprightness, answer thus returned.</l>
                    <l>Fair Angel, thy desire, which tends to know</l>
                    <l>The works of God, thereby to glorify</l>
                    <l>The great Work-master, leads to no excess</l>
                    <l>That reaches blame, but rather merits praise</l>
                    <l>The more it seems excess, that led thee hither</l>
                    <l>From thy empyreal mansion thus alone,</l>
                    <l>To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps,</l>
                    <l>Contented with report, hear only in Heaven:</l>
                    <l>For wonderful indeed are all his works,</l>
                    <l>Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all</l>
                    <l>Had in remembrance always with delight;</l>
                    <l>But what created mind can comprehend</l>
                    <l>Their number, or the wisdom infinite</l>
                    <l>That brought them forth, but hid their causes deep?</l>
                    <l>I saw when at his word the formless mass,</l>
                    <l>This world’s material mould, came to a heap:</l>
                    <l>Confusion heard his voice, and wild uproar</l>
                    <l>Stood ruled, stood vast infinitude confined;</l>
                    <l>Till at his second bidding Darkness fled,</l>
                    <l>Light shone, and order from disorder sprung:</l>
                    <l>Swift to their several quarters hasted then</l>
                    <l>The cumbrous elements, earth, flood, air, fire;</l>
                    <l>And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven</l>
                    <l>Flew upward, spirited with various forms,</l>
                    <l>That rolled orbicular, and turned to stars</l>
                    <l>Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move;</l>
                    <l>Each had his place appointed, each his course;</l>
                    <l>The rest in circuit walls this universe.</l>
                    <l>Look downward on that globe, whose hither side</l>
                    <l>With light from hence, though but reflected, shines;</l>
                    <l>That place is Earth, the seat of Man; that light</l>
                    <l>His day, which else, as the other hemisphere,</l>
                    <l>Night would invade; but there the neighbouring moon</l>
                    <l>(So call that opposite fair star) her aid</l>
                    <l>Timely interposes, and her monthly round</l>
                    <l>Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heaven,</l>
                    <l>With borrowed light her countenance triform</l>
                    <l>Hence fills and empties to enlighten the Earth,</l>
                    <l>And in her pale dominion checks the night.</l>
                    <l>That spot, to which I point, is Paradise,</l>
                    <l>Adam’s abode; those lofty shades, his bower.</l>
                    <l>Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.</l>
                    <l>Thus said, he turned; and Satan, bowing low,</l>
                    <l>As to superiour Spirits is wont in Heaven,</l>
                    <l>Where honour due and reverence none neglects,</l>
                    <l>Took leave, and toward the coast of earth beneath,</l>
                    <l>Down from the ecliptick, sped with hoped success,</l>
                    <l>Throws his steep flight in many an aery wheel;</l>
                    <l>Nor staid, till on Niphates’ top he lights.</l>

                <lg>
                    <l>O, for that warning voice, which he, who saw</l>
                    <l>The Apocalypse, heard cry in Heaven aloud,</l>
                    <l>Then when the Dragon, put to second rout,</l>
                    <l>Came furious down to be revenged on men,</l>
                    <l>Woe to the inhabitants on earth! that now,</l>
                    <l>While time was, our first parents had been warned</l>
                    <l>The coming of their secret foe, and ’scaped,</l>
                    <l>Haply so ’scaped his mortal snare: For now</l>
                    <l>Satan, now first inflamed with rage, came down,</l>
                    <l>The tempter ere the accuser of mankind,</l>
                    <l>To wreak on innocent frail Man his loss</l>
                    <l>Of that first battle, and his flight to Hell:</l>
                    <l>Yet, not rejoicing in his speed, though bold</l>
                    <l>Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast,</l>
                    <l>Begins his dire attempt; which nigh the birth</l>
                    <l>Now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast,</l>
                    <l>And like a devilish engine back recoils</l>
                    <l>Upon himself; horrour and doubt distract</l>
                    <l>His troubled thoughts, and from the bottom stir</l>
                    <l>The Hell within him; for within him Hell</l>
                    <l>He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell</l>
                    <l>One step, no more than from himself, can fly</l>
                    <l>By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair,</l>
                    <l>That slumbered; wakes the bitter memory</l>
                    <l>Of what he was, what is, and what must be</l>
                    <l>Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.</l>
                    <l>Sometimes towards Eden, which now in his view</l>
                    <l>Lay pleasant, his grieved look he fixes sad;</l>
                    <l>Sometimes towards Heaven, and the full-blazing sun,</l>
                    <l>Which now sat high in his meridian tower:</l>
                    <l>Then, much revolving, thus in sighs began.</l>
                    <l>O thou, that, with surpassing glory crowned,</l>
                    <l>Lookest from thy sole dominion like the God</l>
                    <l>Of this new world; at whose sight all the stars</l>
                    <l>Hide their diminished heads; to thee I call,</l>
                    <l>But with no friendly voice, and add thy name,</l>
                    <l>Of Sun! to tell thee how I hate thy beams,</l>
                    <l>That bring to my remembrance from what state</l>
                    <l>I fell, how glorious once above thy sphere;</l>
                    <l>Till pride and worse ambition threw me down</l>
                    <l>Warring in Heaven against Heaven’s matchless King:</l>
                    <l>Ah, wherefore! he deserved no such return</l>
                    <l>From me, whom he created what I was</l>
                    <l>In that bright eminence, and with his good</l>
                    <l>Upbraided none; nor was his service hard.</l>
                    <l>What could be less than to afford him praise,</l>
                    <l>The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks,</l>
                    <l>How due! yet all his good proved ill in me,</l>
                    <l>And wrought but malice; lifted up so high</l>
                    <l>I ’sdeined subjection, and thought one step higher</l>
                    <l>Would set me highest, and in a moment quit</l>
                    <l>The debt immense of endless gratitude,</l>
                    <l>So burdensome still paying, still to owe,</l>
                    <l>Forgetful what from him I still received,</l>
                    <l>And understood not that a grateful mind</l>
                    <l>By owing owes not, but still pays, at once</l>
                    <l>Indebted and discharged; what burden then</l>
                    <l>O, had his powerful destiny ordained</l>
                    <l>Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood</l>
                    <l>Then happy; no unbounded hope had raised</l>
                    <l>Ambition! Yet why not some other Power</l>
                    <l>As great might have aspired, and me, though mean,</l>
                    <l>Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great</l>
                    <l>Fell not, but stand unshaken, from within</l>
                    <l>Or from without, to all temptations armed.</l>
                    <l>Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand?</l>
                    <l>Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse,</l>
                    <l>But Heaven’s free love dealt equally to all?</l>
                    <l>Be then his love accursed, since love or hate,</l>
                    <l>To me alike, it deals eternal woe.</l>
                    <l>Nay, cursed be thou; since against his thy will</l>
                    <l>Chose freely what it now so justly rues.</l>
                    <l>Me miserable! which way shall I fly</l>
                    <l>Infinite wrath, and infinite despair?</l>
                    <l>Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell;</l>
                    <l>And, in the lowest deep, a lower deep</l>
                    <l>Still threatening to devour me opens wide,</l>
                    <l>To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven.</l>
                    <l>O, then, at last relent: Is there no place</l>
                    <l>Left for repentance, none for pardon left?</l>
                    <l>None left but by submission; and that word</l>
                    <l>Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame</l>
                    <l>Among the Spirits beneath, whom I seduced</l>
                    <l>With other promises and other vaunts</l>
                    <l>Than to submit, boasting I could subdue</l>
                    <l>The Omnipotent. Ay me! they little know</l>
                    <l>How dearly I abide that boast so vain,</l>
                    <l>Under what torments inwardly I groan,</l>
                    <l>While they adore me on the throne of Hell.</l>
                    <l>With diadem and scepter high advanced,</l>
                    <l>The lower still I fall, only supreme</l>
                    <l>In misery: Such joy ambition finds.</l>
                    <l>But say I could repent, and could obtain,</l>
                    <l>By act of grace, my former state; how soon</l>
                    <l>Would highth recall high thoughts, how soon unsay</l>
                    <l>What feigned submission swore? Ease would recant</l>
                    <l>Vows made in pain, as violent and void.</l>
                    <l>For never can true reconcilement grow,</l>
                    <l>Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep:</l>
                    <l>Which would but lead me to a worse relapse</l>
                    <l>And heavier fall: so should I purchase dear</l>
                    <l>Short intermission bought with double smart.</l>
                    <l>This knows my Punisher; therefore as far</l>
                    <l>From granting he, as I from begging, peace;</l>
                    <l>All hope excluded thus, behold, instead</l>
                    <l>Of us out-cast, exil’d, his new delight,</l>
                    <l>Mankind created, and for him this world.</l>
                    <l>So farewell, hope; and with hope farewell, fear;</l>
                    <l>Farewell, remorse! all good to me is lost;</l>
                    <l>Evil, be thou my good; by thee at least</l>
                    <l>Divided empire with Heaven’s King I hold,</l>
                    <l>By thee, and more than half perhaps will reign;</l>
                    <l>As Man ere long, and this new world, shall know.</l>
                    <l>Thus while he spake, each passion dimmed his face</l>
                    <l>Thrice changed with pale, ire, envy, and despair;</l>
                    <l>Which marred his borrowed visage, and betrayed</l>
                    <l>Him counterfeit, if any eye beheld.</l>
                    <l>For heavenly minds from such distempers foul</l>
                    <l>Are ever clear. Whereof he soon aware,</l>
                    <l>Each perturbation smoothed with outward calm,</l>
                    <l>Artificer of fraud; and was the first</l>
                    <l>That practised falsehood under saintly show,</l>
                    <l>Deep malice to conceal, couched with revenge:</l>
                    <l>Yet not enough had practised to deceive</l>
                    <l>Uriel once warned; whose eye pursued him down</l>
                    <l>The way he went, and on the Assyrian mount</l>
                    <l>Saw him disfigured, more than could befall</l>
                    <l>Spirit of happy sort; his gestures fierce</l>
                    <l>He marked and mad demeanour, then alone,</l>
                    <l>As he supposed, all unobserved, unseen.</l>
                    <l>So on he fares, and to the border comes</l>
                    <l>Of Eden, where delicious Paradise,</l>
                    <l>Now nearer, crowns with her enclosure green,</l>
                    <l>As with a rural mound, the champaign head</l>
                    <l>Of a steep wilderness, whose hairy sides</l>
                    <l>With thicket overgrown, grotesque and wild,</l>
                    <l>Access denied; and overhead upgrew</l>
                    <l>Insuperable height of loftiest shade,</l>
                    <l>Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm,</l>
                    <l>A sylvan scene, and, as the ranks ascend,</l>
                    <l>Shade above shade, a woody theatre</l>
                    <l>Of stateliest view. Yet higher than their tops</l>
                    <l>The verdurous wall of Paradise upsprung;</l>
                    <l>Which to our general sire gave prospect large</l>
                    <l>Into his nether empire neighbouring round.</l>
                    <l>And higher than that wall a circling row</l>
                    <l>Of goodliest trees, loaden with fairest fruit,</l>
                    <l>Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue,</l>
                    <l>Appeared, with gay enamelled colours mixed:</l>
                    <l>On which the sun more glad impressed his beams</l>
                    <l>Than in fair evening cloud, or humid bow,</l>
                    <l>When God hath showered the earth; so lovely seemed</l>
                    <l>That landskip: And of pure now purer air</l>
                    <l>Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires</l>
                    <l>Vernal delight and joy, able to drive</l>
                    <l>All sadness but despair: Now gentle gales,</l>
                    <l>Fanning their odoriferous wings, dispense</l>
                    <l>Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole</l>
                    <l>Those balmy spoils. As when to them who fail</l>
                    <l>Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past</l>
                    <l>Mozambick, off at sea north-east winds blow</l>
                    <l>Sabean odours from the spicy shore</l>
                    <l>Of Araby the blest; with such delay</l>
                    <l>Well pleased they slack their course, and many a league</l>
                    <l>Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles:</l>
                    <l>So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend,</l>
                    <l>Who came their bane; though with them better pleased</l>
                    <l>Than Asmodeus with the fishy fume</l>
                    <l>That drove him, though enamoured, from the spouse</l>
                    <l>Of Tobit’s son, and with a vengeance sent</l>
                    <l>From Media post to Egypt, there fast bound.</l>
                    <l>Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill</l>
                    <l>Satan had journeyed on, pensive and slow;</l>
                    <l>But further way found none, so thick entwined,</l>
                    <l>As one continued brake, the undergrowth</l>
                    <l>Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed</l>
                    <l>All path of man or beast that passed that way.</l>
                    <l>One gate there only was, and that looked east</l>
                    <l>On the other side: which when the arch-felon saw,</l>
                    <l>Due entrance he disdained; and, in contempt,</l>
                    <l>At one flight bound high over-leaped all bound</l>
                    <l>Of hill or highest wall, and sheer within</l>
                    <l>Lights on his feet. As when a prowling wolf,</l>
                    <l>Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey,</l>
                    <l>Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve</l>
                    <l>In hurdled cotes amid the field secure,</l>
                    <l>Leaps o’er the fence with ease into the fold:</l>
                    <l>Or as a thief, bent to unhoard the cash</l>
                    <l>Of some rich burgher, whose substantial doors,</l>
                    <l>Cross-barred and bolted fast, fear no assault,</l>
                    <l>In at the window climbs, or o’er the tiles:</l>
                    <l>So clomb this first grand thief into God’s fold;</l>
                    <l>So since into his church lewd hirelings climb.</l>
                    <l>Thence up he flew, and on the tree of life,</l>
                    <l>The middle tree and highest there that grew,</l>
                    <l>Sat like a cormorant; yet not true life</l>
                    <l>Thereby regained, but sat devising death</l>
                    <l>To them who lived; nor on the virtue thought</l>
                    <l>Of that life-giving plant, but only used</l>
                    <l>For prospect, what well used had been the pledge</l>
                    <l>Of immortality. So little knows</l>
                    <l>Any, but God alone, to value right</l>
                    <l>The good before him, but perverts best things</l>
                    <l>To worst abuse, or to their meanest use.</l>
                    <l>Beneath him with new wonder now he views,</l>
                    <l>To all delight of human sense exposed,</l>
                    <l>In narrow room, Nature’s whole wealth, yea more,</l>
                    <l>A Heaven on Earth: For blissful Paradise</l>
                    <l>Of God the garden was, by him in the east</l>
                    <l>Of Eden planted; Eden stretched her line</l>
                    <l>From Auran eastward to the royal towers</l>
                    <l>Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian kings,</l>
                    <l>Or where the sons of Eden long before</l>
                    <l>Dwelt in Telassar: In this pleasant soil</l>
                    <l>His far more pleasant garden God ordained;</l>
                    <l>Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow</l>
                    <l>All trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;</l>
                    <l>And all amid them stood the tree of life,</l>
                    <l>High eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit</l>
                    <l>Of vegetable gold; and next to life,</l>
                    <l>Our death, the tree of knowledge, grew fast by,</l>
                    <l>Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill.</l>
                    <l>Southward through Eden went a river large,</l>
                    <l>Nor changed his course, but through the shaggy hill</l>
                    <l>Passed underneath ingulfed; for God had thrown</l>
                    <l>That mountain as his garden-mould high raised</l>
                    <l>Upon the rapid current, which, through veins</l>
                    <l>Of porous earth with kindly thirst up-drawn,</l>
                    <l>Rose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill</l>
                    <l>Watered the garden; thence united fell</l>
                    <l>Down the steep glade, and met the nether flood,</l>
                    <l>Which from his darksome passage now appears,</l>
                    <l>And now, divided into four main streams,</l>
                    <l>Runs diverse, wandering many a famous realm</l>
                    <l>And country, whereof here needs no account;</l>
                    <l>But rather to tell how, if Art could tell,</l>
                    <l>How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks,</l>
                    <l>Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold,</l>
                    <l>With mazy errour under pendant shades</l>
                    <l>Ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed</l>
                    <l>Flowers worthy of Paradise, which not nice Art</l>
                    <l>In beds and curious knots, but Nature boon</l>
                    <l>Poured forth profuse on hill, and dale, and plain,</l>
                    <l>Both where the morning sun first warmly smote</l>
                    <l>The open field, and where the unpierced shade</l>
                    <l>Imbrowned the noontide bowers: Thus was this place</l>
                    <l>A happy rural seat of various view;</l>
                    <l>Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm,</l>
                    <l>Others whose fruit, burnished with golden rind,</l>
                    <l>Hung amiable, Hesperian fables true,</l>
                    <l>If true, here only, and of delicious taste:</l>
                    <l>Betwixt them lawns, or level downs, and flocks</l>
                    <l>Grazing the tender herb, were interposed,</l>
                    <l>Or palmy hillock; or the flowery lap</l>
                    <l>Of some irriguous valley spread her store,</l>
                    <l>Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose:</l>
                    <l>Another side, umbrageous grots and caves</l>
                    <l>Of cool recess, o’er which the mantling vine</l>
                    <l>Lays forth her purple grape, and gently creeps</l>
                    <l>Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall</l>
                    <l>Down the slope hills, dispersed, or in a lake,</l>
                    <l>That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned</l>
                    <l>Her crystal mirrour holds, unite their streams.</l>
                    <l>The birds their quire apply; airs, vernal airs,</l>
                    <l>Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune</l>
                    <l>The trembling leaves, while universal Pan,</l>
                    <l>Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance,</l>
                    <l>Led on the eternal Spring. Not that fair field</l>
                    <l>Of Enna, where Proserpine gathering flowers,</l>
                    <l>Herself a fairer flower by gloomy Dis</l>
                    <l>Was gathered, which cost Ceres all that pain</l>
                    <l>To seek her through the world; nor that sweet grove</l>
                    <l>Of Daphne by Orontes, and the inspired</l>
                    <l>Castalian spring, might with this Paradise</l>
                    <l>Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian isle</l>
                    <l>Girt with the river Triton, where old Cham,</l>
                    <l>Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove,</l>
                    <l>Hid Amalthea, and her florid son</l>
                    <l>Young Bacchus, from his stepdame Rhea’s eye;</l>
                    <l>Nor where Abassin kings their issue guard,</l>
                    <l>Mount Amara, though this by some supposed</l>
                    <l>True Paradise under the Ethiop line</l>
                    <l>By Nilus’ head, enclosed with shining rock,</l>
                    <l>A whole day’s journey high, but wide remote</l>
                    <l>From this Assyrian garden, where the Fiend</l>
                    <l>Saw, undelighted, all delight, all kind</l>
                    <l>Of living creatures, new to sight, and strange</l>
                    <l>Two of far nobler shape, erect and tall,</l>
                    <l>Godlike erect, with native honour clad</l>
                    <l>In naked majesty seemed lords of all:</l>
                    <l>And worthy seemed; for in their looks divine</l>
                    <l>The image of their glorious Maker shone,</l>
                    <l>Truth, wisdom, sanctitude severe and pure,</l>
                    <l>(Severe, but in true filial freedom placed,)</l>
                    <l>Whence true authority in men; though both</l>
                    <l>Not equal, as their sex not equal seemed;</l>
                    <l>For contemplation he and valour formed;</l>
                    <l>For softness she and sweet attractive grace;</l>
                    <l>He for God only, she for God in him:</l>
                    <l>His fair large front and eye sublime declared</l>
                    <l>Absolute rule; and hyacinthine locks</l>
                    <l>Round from his parted forelock manly hung</l>
                    <l>Clustering, but not beneath his shoulders broad:</l>
                    <l>She, as a veil, down to the slender waist</l>
                    <l>Her unadorned golden tresses wore</l>
                    <l>Dishevelled, but in wanton ringlets waved</l>
                    <l>As the vine curls her tendrils, which implied</l>
                    <l>Subjection, but required with gentle sway,</l>
                    <l>And by her yielded, by him best received,</l>
                    <l>Yielded with coy submission, modest pride,</l>
                    <l>And sweet, reluctant, amorous delay.</l>
                    <l>Nor those mysterious parts were then concealed;</l>
                    <l>Then was not guilty shame, dishonest shame</l>
                    <l>Of nature’s works, honour dishonourable,</l>
                    <l>Sin-bred, how have ye troubled all mankind</l>
                    <l>With shows instead, mere shows of seeming pure,</l>
                    <l>And banished from man’s life his happiest life,</l>
                    <l>Simplicity and spotless innocence!</l>
                    <l>So passed they naked on, nor shunned the sight</l>
                    <l>Of God or Angel; for they thought no ill:</l>
                    <l>So hand in hand they passed, the loveliest pair,</l>
                    <l>That ever since in love’s embraces met;</l>
                    <l>Adam the goodliest man of men since born</l>
                    <l>His sons, the fairest of her daughters Eve.</l>
                    <l>Under a tuft of shade that on a green</l>
                    <l>Stood whispering soft, by a fresh fountain side</l>
                    <l>They sat them down; and, after no more toil</l>
                    <l>Of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed</l>
                    <l>To recommend cool Zephyr, and made ease</l>
                    <l>More easy, wholesome thirst and appetite</l>
                    <l>More grateful, to their supper-fruits they fell,</l>
                    <l>Nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs</l>
                    <l>Yielded them, side-long as they sat recline</l>
                    <l>On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers:</l>
                    <l>The savoury pulp they chew, and in the rind,</l>
                    <l>Still as they thirsted, scoop the brimming stream;</l>
                    <l>Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles</l>
                    <l>Wanted, nor youthful dalliance, as beseems</l>
                    <l>Fair couple, linked in happy nuptial league,</l>
                    <l>Alone as they. About them frisking played</l>
                    <l>All beasts of the earth, since wild, and of all chase</l>
                    <l>In wood or wilderness, forest or den;</l>
                    <l>Sporting the lion ramped, and in his paw</l>
                    <l>Dandled the kid; bears, tigers, ounces, pards,</l>
                    <l>Gambolled before them; the unwieldy elephant,</l>
                    <l>To make them mirth, used all his might, and wreathed</l>
                    <l>His lithe proboscis; close the serpent sly,</l>
                    <l>Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine</l>
                    <l>His braided train, and of his fatal guile</l>
                    <l>Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass</l>
                    <l>Couched, and now filled with pasture gazing sat,</l>
                    <l>Or bedward ruminating; for the sun,</l>
                    <l>Declined, was hasting now with prone career</l>
                    <l>To the ocean isles, and in the ascending scale</l>
                    <l>Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose:</l>
                    <l>When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood,</l>
                    <l>Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad.</l>
                    <l>O Hell! what do mine eyes with grief behold!</l>
                    <l>Into our room of bliss thus high advanced</l>
                    <l>Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps,</l>
                    <l>Not Spirits, yet to heavenly Spirits bright</l>
                    <l>Little inferiour; whom my thoughts pursue</l>
                    <l>With wonder, and could love, so lively shines</l>
                    <l>In them divine resemblance, and such grace</l>
                    <l>The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured.</l>
                    <l>Ah! gentle pair, ye little think how nigh</l>
                    <l>Your change approaches, when all these delights</l>
                    <l>Will vanish, and deliver ye to woe;</l>
                    <l>More woe, the more your taste is now of joy;</l>
                    <l>Happy, but for so happy ill secured</l>
                    <l>Long to continue, and this high seat your Heaven</l>
                    <l>Ill fenced for Heaven to keep out such a foe</l>
                    <l>As now is entered; yet no purposed foe</l>
                    <l>To you, whom I could pity thus forlorn,</l>
                    <l>Though I unpitied: League with you I seek,</l>
                    <l>And mutual amity, so strait, so close,</l>
                    <l>That I with you must dwell, or you with me</l>
                    <l>Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please,</l>
                    <l>Like this fair Paradise, your sense; yet such</l>
                    <l>Accept your Maker’s work; he gave it me,</l>
                    <l>Which I as freely give: Hell shall unfold,</l>
                    <l>To entertain you two, her widest gates,</l>
                    <l>And send forth all her kings; there will be room,</l>
                    <l>Not like these narrow limits, to receive</l>
                    <l>Your numerous offspring; if no better place,</l>
                    <l>Thank him who puts me loth to this revenge</l>
                    <l>On you who wrong me not for him who wronged.</l>
                    <l>And should I at your harmless innocence</l>
                    <l>Melt, as I do, yet publick reason just,</l>
                    <l>Honour and empire with revenge enlarged,</l>
                    <l>By conquering this new world, compels me now</l>
                    <l>To do what else, though damned, I should abhor.</l>
                    <l>So spake the Fiend, and with necessity,</l>
                    <l>The tyrant’s plea, excused his devilish deeds.</l>
                    <l>Then from his lofty stand on that high tree</l>
                    <l>Down he alights among the sportful herd</l>
                    <l>Of those four-footed kinds, himself now one,</l>
                    <l>Now other, as their shape served best his end</l>
                    <l>Nearer to view his prey, and, unespied,</l>
                    <l>To mark what of their state he more might learn,</l>
                    <l>By word or action marked. About them round</l>
                    <l>A lion now he stalks with fiery glare;</l>
                    <l>Then as a tiger, who by chance hath spied</l>
                    <l>In some purlieu two gentle fawns at play,</l>
                    <l>Straight couches close, then, rising, changes oft</l>
                    <l>His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground,</l>
                    <l>Whence rushing, he might surest seize them both,</l>
                    <l>Griped in each paw: when, Adam first of men</l>
                    <l>To first of women Eve thus moving speech,</l>
                    <l>Turned him, all ear to hear new utterance flow.</l>
                    <l>Sole partner, and sole part, of all these joys,</l>
                    <l>Dearer thyself than all; needs must the Power</l>
                    <l>That made us, and for us this ample world,</l>
                    <l>Be infinitely good, and of his good</l>
                    <l>As liberal and free as infinite;</l>
                    <l>That raised us from the dust, and placed us here</l>
                    <l>In all this happiness, who at his hand</l>
                    <l>Have nothing merited, nor can perform</l>
                    <l>Aught whereof he hath need; he who requires</l>
                    <l>From us no other service than to keep</l>
                    <l>This one, this easy charge, of all the trees</l>
                    <l>In Paradise that bear delicious fruit</l>
                    <l>So various, not to taste that only tree</l>
                    <l>Of knowledge, planted by the tree of life;</l>
                    <l>So near grows death to life, whate’er death is,</l>
                    <l>Some dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowest</l>
                    <l>God hath pronounced it death to taste that tree,</l>
                    <l>The only sign of our obedience left,</l>
                    <l>Among so many signs of power and rule</l>
                    <l>Conferred upon us, and dominion given</l>
                    <l>Over all other creatures that possess</l>
                    <l>Earth, air, and sea. Then let us not think hard</l>
                    <l>One easy prohibition, who enjoy</l>
                    <l>Free leave so large to all things else, and choice</l>
                    <l>Unlimited of manifold delights:</l>
                    <l>But let us ever praise him, and extol</l>
                    <l>His bounty, following our delightful task,</l>
                    <l>To prune these growing plants, and tend these flowers,</l>
                    <l>Which were it toilsome, yet with thee were sweet.</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Eve replied. O thou for whom</l>
                    <l>And from whom I was formed, flesh of thy flesh,</l>
                    <l>And without whom am to no end, my guide</l>
                    <l>And head! what thou hast said is just and right.</l>
                    <l>For we to him indeed all praises owe,</l>
                    <l>And daily thanks; I chiefly, who enjoy</l>
                    <l>So far the happier lot, enjoying thee</l>
                    <l>Pre-eminent by so much odds, while thou</l>
                    <l>Like consort to thyself canst no where find.</l>
                    <l>That day I oft remember, when from sleep</l>
                    <l>I first awaked, and found myself reposed</l>
                    <l>Under a shade on flowers, much wondering where</l>
                    <l>And what I was, whence thither brought, and how.</l>
                    <l>Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound</l>
                    <l>Of waters issued from a cave, and spread</l>
                    <l>Into a liquid plain, then stood unmoved</l>
                    <l>Pure as the expanse of Heaven; I thither went</l>
                    <l>With unexperienced thought, and laid me down</l>
                    <l>On the green bank, to look into the clear</l>
                    <l>Smooth lake, that to me seemed another sky.</l>
                    <l>As I bent down to look, just opposite</l>
                    <l>A shape within the watery gleam appeared,</l>
                    <l>Bending to look on me: I started back,</l>
                    <l>It started back; but pleased I soon returned,</l>
                    <l>Pleased it returned as soon with answering looks</l>
                    <l>Of sympathy and love: There I had fixed</l>
                    <l>Mine eyes till now, and pined with vain desire,</l>
                    <l>Had not a voice thus warned me; “What thou seest,</l>
                    <l>What there thou seest, fair Creature, is thyself;</l>
                    <l>With thee it came and goes: but follow me,</l>
                    <l>And I will bring thee where no shadow stays</l>
                    <l>Thy coming, and thy soft embraces, he</l>
                    <l>Whose image thou art; him thou shalt enjoy</l>
                    <l>Inseparably thine, to him shalt bear</l>
                    <l>Multitudes like thyself, and thence be called</l>
                    <l>Mother of human race.” What could I do,</l>
                    <l>But follow straight, invisibly thus led?</l>
                    <l>Till I espied thee, fair indeed and tall,</l>
                    <l>Under a platane; yet methought less fair,</l>
                    <l>Less winning soft, less amiably mild,</l>
                    <l>Than that smooth watery image: Back I turned;</l>
                    <l>Thou following cryedst aloud, “Return, fair Eve;</l>
                    <l>Whom flyest thou? whom thou flyest, of him thou art,</l>
                    <l>His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent</l>
                    <l>Out of my side to thee, nearest my heart,</l>
                    <l>Substantial life, to have thee by my side</l>
                    <l>Henceforth an individual solace dear;</l>
                    <l>Part of my soul I seek thee, and thee claim</l>
                    <l>My other half:” With that thy gentle hand</l>
                    <l>Seised mine: I yielded; and from that time see</l>
                    <l>How beauty is excelled by manly grace,</l>
                    <l>And wisdom, which alone is truly fair.</l>
                    <l>So spake our general mother, and with eyes</l>
                    <l>Of conjugal attraction unreproved,</l>
                    <l>And meek surrender, half-embracing leaned</l>
                    <l>On our first father; half her swelling breast</l>
                    <l>Naked met his, under the flowing gold</l>
                    <l>Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight</l>
                    <l>Both of her beauty, and submissive charms,</l>
                    <l>Smiled with superiour love, as Jupiter</l>
                    <l>On Juno smiles, when he impregns the clouds</l>
                    <l>That shed Mayflowers; and pressed her matron lip</l>
                    <l>With kisses pure: Aside the Devil turned</l>
                    <l>For envy; yet with jealous leer malign</l>
                    <l>Eyed them askance, and to himself thus plained.</l>
                    <l>Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two,</l>
                    <l>Imparadised in one another’s arms,</l>
                    <l>The happier Eden, shall enjoy their fill</l>
                    <l>Of bliss on bliss; while I to Hell am thrust,</l>
                    <l>Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire,</l>
                    <l>Among our other torments not the least,</l>
                    <l>Still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines.</l>
                    <l>Yet let me not forget what I have gained</l>
                    <l>From their own mouths: All is not theirs, it seems;</l>
                    <l>One fatal tree there stands, of knowledge called,</l>
                    <l>Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidden</l>
                    <l>Suspicious, reasonless. Why should their Lord</l>
                    <l>Envy them that? Can it be sin to know?</l>
                    <l>Can it be death? And do they only stand</l>
                    <l>By ignorance? Is that their happy state,</l>
                    <l>The proof of their obedience and their faith?</l>
                    <l>O fair foundation laid whereon to build</l>
                    <l>Their ruin! hence I will excite their minds</l>
                    <l>With more desire to know, and to reject</l>
                    <l>Envious commands, invented with design</l>
                    <l>To keep them low, whom knowledge might exalt</l>
                    <l>Equal with Gods: aspiring to be such,</l>
                    <l>They taste and die: What likelier can ensue</l>
                    <l>But first with narrow search I must walk round</l>
                    <l>This garden, and no corner leave unspied;</l>
                    <l>A chance but chance may lead where I may meet</l>
                    <l>Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side,</l>
                    <l>Or in thick shade retired, from him to draw</l>
                    <l>What further would be learned. Live while ye may,</l>
                    <l>Yet happy pair; enjoy, till I return,</l>
                    <l>Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed!</l>
                    <l>So saying, his proud step he scornful turned,</l>
                    <l>But with sly circumspection, and began</l>
                    <l>Through wood, through waste, o’er hill, o’er dale, his roam</l>
                    <l>Mean while in utmost longitude, where Heaven</l>
                    <l>With earth and ocean meets, the setting sun</l>
                    <l>Slowly descended, and with right aspect</l>
                    <l>Against the eastern gate of Paradise</l>
                    <l>Levelled his evening rays: It was a rock</l>
                    <l>Of alabaster, piled up to the clouds,</l>
                    <l>Conspicuous far, winding with one ascent</l>
                    <l>Accessible from earth, one entrance high;</l>
                    <l>The rest was craggy cliff, that overhung</l>
                    <l>Still as it rose, impossible to climb.</l>
                    <l>Betwixt these rocky pillars Gabriel sat,</l>
                    <l>Chief of the angelick guards, awaiting night;</l>
                    <l>About him exercised heroick games</l>
                    <l>The unarmed youth of Heaven, but nigh at hand</l>
                    <l>Celestial armoury, shields, helms, and spears,</l>
                    <l>Hung high with diamond flaming, and with gold.</l>
                    <l>Thither came Uriel, gliding through the even</l>
                    <l>On a sun-beam, swift as a shooting star</l>
                    <l>In autumn thwarts the night, when vapours fired</l>
                    <l>Impress the air, and shows the mariner</l>
                    <l>From what point of his compass to beware</l>
                    <l>Impetuous winds: He thus began in haste.</l>
                    <l>Gabriel, to thee thy course by lot hath given</l>
                    <l>Charge and strict watch, that to this happy place</l>
                    <l>No evil thing approach or enter in.</l>
                    <l>This day at highth of noon came to my sphere</l>
                    <l>A Spirit, zealous, as he seemed, to know</l>
                    <l>More of the Almighty’s works, and chiefly Man,</l>
                    <l>God’s latest image: I described his way</l>
                    <l>Bent all on speed, and marked his aery gait;</l>
                    <l>But in the mount that lies from Eden north,</l>
                    <l>Where he first lighted, soon discerned his looks</l>
                    <l>Alien from Heaven, with passions foul obscured:</l>
                    <l>Mine eye pursued him still, but under shade</l>
                    <l>Lost sight of him: One of the banished crew,</l>
                    <l>I fear, hath ventured from the deep, to raise</l>
                    <l>New troubles; him thy care must be to find.</l>
                    <l>To whom the winged warriour thus returned.</l>
                    <l>Uriel, no wonder if thy perfect sight,</l>
                    <l>Amid the sun’s bright circle where thou sitst,</l>
                    <l>See far and wide: In at this gate none pass</l>
                    <l>The vigilance here placed, but such as come</l>
                    <l>Well known from Heaven; and since meridian hour</l>
                    <l>No creature thence: If Spirit of other sort,</l>
                    <l>So minded, have o’er-leaped these earthly bounds</l>
                    <l>On purpose, hard thou knowest it to exclude</l>
                    <l>Spiritual substance with corporeal bar.</l>
                    <l>But if within the circuit of these walks,</l>
                    <l>In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom</l>
                    <l>Thou tellest, by morrow dawning I shall know.</l>
                    <l>So promised he; and Uriel to his charge</l>
                    <l>Returned on that bright beam, whose point now raised</l>
                    <l>Bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen</l>
                    <l>Beneath the Azores; whether the prime orb,</l>
                    <l>Incredible how swift, had thither rolled</l>
                    <l>Diurnal, or this less volubil earth,</l>
                    <l>By shorter flight to the east, had left him there</l>
                    <l>Arraying with reflected purple and gold</l>
                    <l>The clouds that on his western throne attend.</l>
                    <l>Now came still Evening on, and Twilight gray</l>
                    <l>Had in her sober livery all things clad;</l>
                    <l>Silence accompanied; for beast and bird,</l>
                    <l>They to their grassy couch, these to their nests</l>
                    <l>Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale;</l>
                    <l>She all night long her amorous descant sung;</l>
                    <l>Silence was pleased: Now glowed the firmament</l>
                    <l>With living sapphires: Hesperus, that led</l>
                    <l>The starry host, rode brightest, till the moon,</l>
                    <l>Rising in clouded majesty, at length</l>
                    <l>Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light,</l>
                    <l>And o’er the dark her silver mantle threw.</l>
                    <l>When Adam thus to Eve. Fair Consort, the hour</l>
                    <l>Of night, and all things now retired to rest,</l>
                    <l>Mind us of like repose; since God hath set</l>
                    <l>Labour and rest, as day and night, to men</l>
                    <l>Successive; and the timely dew of sleep,</l>
                    <l>Now falling with soft slumbrous weight, inclines</l>
                    <l>Our eye-lids: Other creatures all day long</l>
                    <l>Rove idle, unemployed, and less need rest;</l>
                    <l>Man hath his daily work of body or mind</l>
                    <l>Appointed, which declares his dignity,</l>
                    <l>And the regard of Heaven on all his ways;</l>
                    <l>While other animals unactive range,</l>
                    <l>And of their doings God takes no account.</l>
                    <l>To-morrow, ere fresh morning streak the east</l>
                    <l>With first approach of light, we must be risen,</l>
                    <l>And at our pleasant labour, to reform</l>
                    <l>Yon flowery arbours, yonder alleys green,</l>
                    <l>Our walk at noon, with branches overgrown,</l>
                    <l>That mock our scant manuring, and require</l>
                    <l>More hands than ours to lop their wanton growth:</l>
                    <l>Those blossoms also, and those dropping gums,</l>
                    <l>That lie bestrown, unsightly and unsmooth,</l>
                    <l>Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease;</l>
                    <l>Mean while, as Nature wills, night bids us rest.</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Eve, with perfect beauty adorned</l>
                    <l>My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst</l>
                    <l>Unargued I obey: So God ordains;</l>
                    <l>God is thy law, thou mine: To know no more</l>
                    <l>Is woman’s happiest knowledge, and her praise.</l>
                    <l>With thee conversing I forget all time;</l>
                    <l>All seasons, and their change, all please alike.</l>
                    <l>Sweet is the breath of Morn, her rising sweet,</l>
                    <l>With charm of earliest birds: pleasant the sun,</l>
                    <l>When first on this delightful land he spreads</l>
                    <l>His orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,</l>
                    <l>Glistering with dew; fragrant the fertile earth</l>
                    <l>After soft showers; and sweet the coming on</l>
                    <l>Of grateful Evening mild; then silent Night,</l>
                    <l>With this her solemn bird, and this fair moon,</l>
                    <l>And these the gems of Heaven, her starry train:</l>
                    <l>But neither breath of Morn, when she ascends</l>
                    <l>With charm of earliest birds; nor rising sun</l>
                    <l>On this delightful land; nor herb, fruit, flower,</l>
                    <l>Glistering with dew; nor fragrance after showers;</l>
                    <l>Nor grateful Evening mild; nor silent Night,</l>
                    <l>With this her solemn bird, nor walk by moon,</l>
                    <l>Or glittering star-light, without thee is sweet.</l>
                    <l>But wherefore all night long shine these? for whom</l>
                    <l>This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes?</l>
                    <l>To whom our general ancestor replied.</l>
                    <l>Daughter of God and Man, accomplished Eve,</l>
                    <l>These have their course to finish round the earth,</l>
                    <l>By morrow evening, and from land to land</l>
                    <l>In order, though to nations yet unborn,</l>
                    <l>Ministring light prepared, they set and rise;</l>
                    <l>Lest total Darkness should by night regain</l>
                    <l>Her old possession, and extinguish life</l>
                    <l>In Nature and all things; which these soft fires</l>
                    <l>Not only enlighten, but with kindly heat</l>
                    <l>Of various influence foment and warm,</l>
                    <l>Temper or nourish, or in part shed down</l>
                    <l>Their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow</l>
                    <l>On earth, made hereby apter to receive</l>
                    <l>Perfection from the sun’s more potent ray.</l>
                    <l>These then, though unbeheld in deep of night,</l>
                    <l>Shine not in vain; nor think, though men were none,</l>
                    <l>That Heaven would want spectators, God want praise:</l>
                    <l>Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth</l>
                    <l>Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:</l>
                    <l>All these with ceaseless praise his works behold</l>
                    <l>Both day and night: How often from the steep</l>
                    <l>Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard</l>
                    <l>Celestial voices to the midnight air,</l>
                    <l>Sole, or responsive each to others note,</l>
                    <l>Singing their great Creator? oft in bands</l>
                    <l>While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk,</l>
                    <l>With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds</l>
                    <l>In full harmonick number joined, their songs</l>
                    <l>Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven.</l>
                    <l>Thus talking, hand in hand alone they passed</l>
                    <l>On to their blissful bower: it was a place</l>
                    <l>Chosen by the sovran Planter, when he framed</l>
                    <l>All things to Man’s delightful use; the roof</l>
                    <l>Of thickest covert was inwoven shade</l>
                    <l>Laurel and myrtle, and what higher grew</l>
                    <l>Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side</l>
                    <l>Acanthus, and each odorous bushy shrub,</l>
                    <l>Fenced up the verdant wall; each beauteous flower,</l>
                    <l>Iris all hues, roses, and jessamin,</l>
                    <l>Reared high their flourished heads between, and wrought</l>
                    <l>Mosaick; underfoot the violet,</l>
                    <l>Crocus, and hyacinth, with rich inlay</l>
                    <l>Broidered the ground, more coloured than with stone</l>
                    <l>Of costliest emblem: Other creature here,</l>
                    <l>Bird, beast, insect, or worm, durst enter none,</l>
                    <l>Such was their awe of Man. In shadier bower</l>
                    <l>More sacred and sequestered, though but feigned,</l>
                    <l>Pan or Sylvanus never slept, nor Nymph</l>
                    <l>Nor Faunus haunted. Here, in close recess,</l>
                    <l>With flowers, garlands, and sweet-smelling herbs,</l>
                    <l>Espoused Eve decked first her nuptial bed;</l>
                    <l>And heavenly quires the hymenaean sung,</l>
                    <l>What day the genial Angel to our sire</l>
                    <l>Brought her in naked beauty more adorned,</l>
                    <l>More lovely, than Pandora, whom the Gods</l>
                    <l>Endowed with all their gifts, and O! too like</l>
                    <l>In sad event, when to the unwiser son</l>
                    <l>Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnared</l>
                    <l>Mankind with her fair looks, to be avenged</l>
                    <l>On him who had stole Jove’s authentick fire.</l>
                    <l>Thus, at their shady lodge arrived, both stood,</l>
                    <l>Both turned, and under open sky adored</l>
                    <l>The God that made both sky, air, earth, and heaven,</l>
                    <l>Which they beheld, the moon’s resplendent globe,</l>
                    <l>And starry pole: Thou also madest the night,</l>
                    <l>Maker Omnipotent, and thou the day,</l>
                    <l>Which we, in our appointed work employed,</l>
                    <l>Have finished, happy in our mutual help</l>
                    <l>And mutual love, the crown of all our bliss</l>
                    <l>Ordained by thee; and this delicious place</l>
                    <l>For us too large, where thy abundance wants</l>
                    <l>Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground.</l>
                    <l>But thou hast promised from us two a race</l>
                    <l>To fill the earth, who shall with us extol</l>
                    <l>Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake,</l>
                    <l>And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep.</l>
                    <l>This said unanimous, and other rites</l>
                    <l>Observing none, but adoration pure</l>
                    <l>Which God likes best, into their inmost bower</l>
                    <l>Handed they went; and, eased the putting off</l>
                    <l>These troublesome disguises which we wear,</l>
                    <l>Straight side by side were laid; nor turned, I ween,</l>
                    <l>Adam from his fair spouse, nor Eve the rites</l>
                    <l>Mysterious of connubial love refused:</l>
                    <l>Whatever hypocrites austerely talk</l>
                    <l>Of purity, and place, and innocence,</l>
                    <l>Defaming as impure what God declares</l>
                    <l>Pure, and commands to some, leaves free to all.</l>
                    <l>Our Maker bids encrease; who bids abstain</l>
                    <l>But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man?</l>
                    <l>Hail, wedded Love, mysterious law, true source</l>
                    <l>Of human offspring, sole propriety</l>
                    <l>In Paradise of all things common else!</l>
                    <l>By thee adulterous Lust was driven from men</l>
                    <l>Among the bestial herds to range; by thee</l>
                    <l>Founded in reason, loyal, just, and pure,</l>
                    <l>Relations dear, and all the charities</l>
                    <l>Of father, son, and brother, first were known.</l>
                    <l>Far be it, that I should write thee sin or blame,</l>
                    <l>Or think thee unbefitting holiest place,</l>
                    <l>Perpetual fountain of domestick sweets,</l>
                    <l>Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced,</l>
                    <l>Present, or past, as saints and patriarchs used.</l>
                    <l>Here Love his golden shafts employs, here lights</l>
                    <l>His constant lamp, and waves his purple wings,</l>
                    <l>Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile</l>
                    <l>Of harlots, loveless, joyless, unendeared,</l>
                    <l>Casual fruition; nor in court-amours,</l>
                    <l>Mixed dance, or wanton mask, or midnight ball,</l>
                    <l>Or serenate, which the starved lover sings</l>
                    <l>To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.</l>
                    <l>These, lulled by nightingales, embracing slept,</l>
                    <l>And on their naked limbs the flowery roof</l>
                    <l>Showered roses, which the morn repaired. Sleep on,</l>
                    <l>Blest pair; and O! yet happiest, if ye seek</l>
                    <l>No happier state, and know to know no more.</l>
                    <l>Now had night measured with her shadowy cone</l>
                    <l>Half way up hill this vast sublunar vault,</l>
                    <l>And from their ivory port the Cherubim,</l>
                    <l>Forth issuing at the accustomed hour, stood armed</l>
                    <l>To their night watches in warlike parade;</l>
                    <l>When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake.</l>
                    <l>Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the south</l>
                    <l>With strictest watch; these other wheel the north;</l>
                    <l>Our circuit meets full west. As flame they part,</l>
                    <l>Half wheeling to the shield, half to the spear.</l>
                    <l>From these, two strong and subtle Spirits he called</l>
                    <l>That near him stood, and gave them thus in charge.</l>
                    <l>Ithuriel and Zephon, with winged speed</l>
                    <l>Search through this garden, leave unsearched no nook;</l>
                    <l>But chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge,</l>
                    <l>Now laid perhaps asleep, secure of harm.</l>
                    <l>This evening from the sun’s decline arrived,</l>
                    <l>Who tells of some infernal Spirit seen</l>
                    <l>Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escaped</l>
                    <l>The bars of Hell, on errand bad no doubt:</l>
                    <l>Such, where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring.</l>
                    <l>So saying, on he led his radiant files,</l>
                    <l>Dazzling the moon; these to the bower direct</l>
                    <l>In search of whom they sought: Him there they found</l>
                    <l>Squat like a toad, close at the ear of Eve,</l>
                    <l>Assaying by his devilish art to reach</l>
                    <l>The organs of her fancy, and with them forge</l>
                    <l>Illusions, as he list, phantasms and dreams;</l>
                    <l>Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint</l>
                    <l>The animal spirits, that from pure blood arise</l>
                    <l>Like gentle breaths from rivers pure, thence raise</l>
                    <l>At least distempered, discontented thoughts,</l>
                    <l>Vain hopes, vain aims, inordinate desires,</l>
                    <l>Blown up with high conceits ingendering pride.</l>
                    <l>Him thus intent Ithuriel with his spear</l>
                    <l>Touched lightly; for no falshood can endure</l>
                    <l>Touch of celestial temper, but returns</l>
                    <l>Of force to its own likeness: Up he starts</l>
                    <l>Discovered and surprised. As when a spark</l>
                    <l>Lights on a heap of nitrous powder, laid</l>
                    <l>Fit for the tun some magazine to store</l>
                    <l>Against a rumoured war, the smutty grain,</l>
                    <l>With sudden blaze diffused, inflames the air;</l>
                    <l>So started up in his own shape the Fiend.</l>
                    <l>Back stept those two fair Angels, half amazed</l>
                    <l>So sudden to behold the grisly king;</l>
                    <l>Yet thus, unmoved with fear, accost him soon.</l>
                    <l>Which of those rebel Spirits adjudged to Hell</l>
                    <l>Comest thou, escaped thy prison? and, transformed,</l>
                    <l>Why sat’st thou like an enemy in wait,</l>
                    <l>Here watching at the head of these that sleep?</l>
                    <l>Know ye not then said Satan, filled with scorn,</l>
                    <l>Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate</l>
                    <l>For you, there sitting where ye durst not soar:</l>
                    <l>Not to know me argues yourselves unknown,</l>
                    <l>The lowest of your throng; or, if ye know,</l>
                    <l>Why ask ye, and superfluous begin</l>
                    <l>Your message, like to end as much in vain?</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn.</l>
                    <l>Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same,</l>
                    <l>Or undiminished brightness to be known,</l>
                    <l>As when thou stoodest in Heaven upright and pure;</l>
                    <l>That glory then, when thou no more wast good,</l>
                    <l>Departed from thee; and thou resemblest now</l>
                    <l>Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul.</l>
                    <l>But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account</l>
                    <l>To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep</l>
                    <l>This place inviolable, and these from harm.</l>
                    <l>So spake the Cherub; and his grave rebuke,</l>
                    <l>Severe in youthful beauty, added grace</l>
                    <l>Invincible: Abashed the Devil stood,</l>
                    <l>And felt how awful goodness is, and saw</l>
                    <l>Virtue in her shape how lovely; saw, and pined</l>
                    <l>His loss; but chiefly to find here observed</l>
                    <l>His lustre visibly impaired; yet seemed</l>
                    <l>Undaunted. If I must contend, said he,</l>
                    <l>Best with the best, the sender, not the sent,</l>
                    <l>Or all at once; more glory will be won,</l>
                    <l>Or less be lost. Thy fear, said Zephon bold,</l>
                    <l>Will save us trial what the least can do</l>
                    <l>Single against thee wicked, and thence weak.</l>
                    <l>The Fiend replied not, overcome with rage;</l>
                    <l>But, like a proud steed reined, went haughty on,</l>
                    <l>Champing his iron curb: To strive or fly</l>
                    <l>He held it vain; awe from above had quelled</l>
                    <l>His heart, not else dismayed. Now drew they nigh</l>
                    <l>The western point, where those half-rounding guards</l>
                    <l>Just met, and closing stood in squadron joined,</l>
                    <l>A waiting next command. To whom their Chief,</l>
                    <l>Gabriel, from the front thus called aloud.</l>
                    <l>O friends! I hear the tread of nimble feet</l>
                    <l>Hasting this way, and now by glimpse discern</l>
                    <l>Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade;</l>
                    <l>And with them comes a third of regal port,</l>
                    <l>But faded splendour wan; who by his gait</l>
                    <l>And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell,</l>
                    <l>Not likely to part hence without contest;</l>
                    <l>Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours.</l>
                    <l>He scarce had ended, when those two approached,</l>
                    <l>And brief related whom they brought, where found,</l>
                    <l>How busied, in what form and posture couched.</l>
                    <l>To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake.</l>
                    <l>Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescribed</l>
                    <l>To thy transgressions, and disturbed the charge</l>
                    <l>Of others, who approve not to transgress</l>
                    <l>By thy example, but have power and right</l>
                    <l>To question thy bold entrance on this place;</l>
                    <l>Employed, it seems, to violate sleep, and those</l>
                    <l>Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss!</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow.</l>
                    <l>Gabriel? thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise,</l>
                    <l>And such I held thee; but this question asked</l>
                    <l>Puts me in doubt. Lives there who loves his pain!</l>
                    <l>Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell,</l>
                    <l>Though thither doomed! Thou wouldst thyself, no doubt</l>
                    <l>And boldly venture to whatever place</l>
                    <l>Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change</l>
                    <l>Torment with ease, and soonest recompense</l>
                    <l>Dole with delight, which in this place I sought;</l>
                    <l>To thee no reason, who knowest only good,</l>
                    <l>But evil hast not tried: and wilt object</l>
                    <l>His will who bounds us! Let him surer bar</l>
                    <l>His iron gates, if he intends our stay</l>
                    <l>In that dark durance: Thus much what was asked.</l>
                    <l>The rest is true, they found me where they say;</l>
                    <l>But that implies not violence or harm.</l>
                    <l>Thus he in scorn. The warlike Angel moved,</l>
                    <l>Disdainfully half smiling, thus replied.</l>
                    <l>O loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise</l>
                    <l>Since Satan fell, whom folly overthrew,</l>
                    <l>And now returns him from his prison ’scaped,</l>
                    <l>Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise</l>
                    <l>Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither</l>
                    <l>Unlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed;</l>
                    <l>So wise he judges it to fly from pain</l>
                    <l>However, and to ’scape his punishment!</l>
                    <l>So judge thou still, presumptuous! till the wrath,</l>
                    <l>Which thou incurrest by flying, meet thy flight</l>
                    <l>Sevenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell,</l>
                    <l>Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain</l>
                    <l>Can equal anger infinite provoked.</l>
                    <l>But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee</l>
                    <l>Came not all hell broke loose? is pain to them</l>
                    <l>Less pain, less to be fled? or thou than they</l>
                    <l>Less hardy to endure? Courageous Chief!</l>
                    <l>The first in flight from pain! hadst thou alleged</l>
                    <l>To thy deserted host this cause of flight,</l>
                    <l>Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.</l>
                    <l>To which the Fiend thus answered, frowning stern.</l>
                    <l>Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain,</l>
                    <l>Insulting Angel! well thou knowest I stood</l>
                    <l>Thy fiercest, when in battle to thy aid</l>
                    <l>The blasting vollied thunder made all speed,</l>
                    <l>And seconded thy else not dreaded spear.</l>
                    <l>But still thy words at random, as before,</l>
                    <l>Argue thy inexperience what behoves</l>
                    <l>From hard assays and ill successes past</l>
                    <l>A faithful leader, not to hazard all</l>
                    <l>Through ways of danger by himself untried:</l>
                    <l>I, therefore, I alone first undertook</l>
                    <l>To wing the desolate abyss, and spy</l>
                    <l>This new created world, whereof in Hell</l>
                    <l>Fame is not silent, here in hope to find</l>
                    <l>Better abode, and my afflicted Powers</l>
                    <l>To settle here on earth, or in mid air;</l>
                    <l>Though for possession put to try once more</l>
                    <l>What thou and thy gay legions dare against;</l>
                    <l>Whose easier business were to serve their Lord</l>
                    <l>High up in Heaven, with songs to hymn his throne,</l>
                    <l>And practised distances to cringe, not fight,</l>
                    <l>To whom the warriour Angel soon replied.</l>
                    <l>To say and straight unsay, pretending first</l>
                    <l>Wise to fly pain, professing next the spy,</l>
                    <l>Argues no leader but a liar traced,</l>
                    <l>Satan, and couldst thou faithful add? O name,</l>
                    <l>O sacred name of faithfulness profaned!</l>
                    <l>Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew?</l>
                    <l>Army of Fiends, fit body to fit head.</l>
                    <l>Was this your discipline and faith engaged,</l>
                    <l>Your military obedience, to dissolve</l>
                    <l>Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme?</l>
                    <l>And thou, sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem</l>
                    <l>Patron of liberty, who more than thou</l>
                    <l>Once fawned, and cringed, and servilely adored</l>
                    <l>Heaven’s awful Monarch? wherefore, but in hope</l>
                    <l>To dispossess him, and thyself to reign?</l>
                    <l>But mark what I arreed thee now, Avant;</l>
                    <l>Fly neither whence thou fledst! If from this hour</l>
                    <l>Within these hallowed limits thou appear,</l>
                    <l>Back to the infernal pit I drag thee chained,</l>
                    <l>And seal thee so, as henceforth not to scorn</l>
                    <l>The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred.</l>
                    <l>So threatened he; but Satan to no threats</l>
                    <l>Gave heed, but waxing more in rage replied.</l>
                    <l>Then when I am thy captive talk of chains,</l>
                    <l>Proud limitary Cherub! but ere then</l>
                    <l>Far heavier load thyself expect to feel</l>
                    <l>From my prevailing arm, though Heaven’s King</l>
                    <l>Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy compeers,</l>
                    <l>Us’d to the yoke, drawest his triumphant wheels</l>
                    <l>In progress through the road of Heaven star-paved.</l>
                    <l>While thus he spake, the angelick squadron bright</l>
                    <l>Turned fiery red, sharpening in mooned horns</l>
                    <l>Their phalanx, and began to hem him round</l>
                    <l>With ported spears, as thick as when a field</l>
                    <l>Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends</l>
                    <l>Her bearded grove of ears, which way the wind</l>
                    <l>Sways them; the careful plowman doubting stands,</l>
                    <l>Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves</l>
                    <l>Prove chaff. On the other side, Satan, alarmed,</l>
                    <l>Collecting all his might, dilated stood,</l>
                    <l>Like Teneriff or Atlas, unremoved:</l>
                    <l>His stature reached the sky, and on his crest</l>
                    <l>Sat Horrour plumed; nor wanted in his grasp</l>
                    <l>What seemed both spear and shield: Now dreadful deeds</l>
                    <l>Might have ensued, nor only Paradise</l>
                    <l>In this commotion, but the starry cope</l>
                    <l>Of Heaven perhaps, or all the elements</l>
                    <l>At least had gone to wrack, disturbed and torn</l>
                    <l>With violence of this conflict, had not soon</l>
                    <l>The Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray,</l>
                    <l>Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales, yet seen</l>
                    <l>Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion sign,</l>
                    <l>Wherein all things created first he weighed,</l>
                    <l>The pendulous round earth with balanced air</l>
                    <l>In counterpoise, now ponders all events,</l>
                    <l>Battles and realms: In these he put two weights,</l>
                    <l>The sequel each of parting and of fight:</l>
                    <l>The latter quick up flew, and kicked the beam,</l>
                    <l>Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend.</l>
                    <l>Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowest mine;</l>
                    <l>Neither our own, but given: What folly then</l>
                    <l>To boast what arms can do? since thine no more</l>
                    <l>Than Heaven permits, nor mine, though doubled now</l>
                    <l>To trample thee as mire: For proof look up,</l>
                    <l>And read thy lot in yon celestial sign;</l>
                    <l>Where thou art weighed, and shown how light, how weak,</l>
                    <l>If thou resist. The Fiend looked up, and knew</l>
                    <l>His mounted scale aloft: Nor more; but fled</l>
                    <l>Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.</l>

                    <l>Now Morn, her rosy steps in the eastern clime</l>
                    <l>Advancing, sowed the earth with orient pearl,</l>
                    <l>When Adam waked, so customed; for his sleep</l>
                    <l>Was aery-light, from pure digestion bred,</l>
                    <l>And temperate vapours bland, which the only sound</l>
                    <l>Of leaves and fuming rills, Aurora’s fan,</l>
                    <l>Lightly dispersed, and the shrill matin song</l>
                    <l>Of birds on every bough; so much the more</l>
                    <l>His wonder was to find unwakened Eve</l>
                    <l>With tresses discomposed, and glowing cheek,</l>
                    <l>As through unquiet rest: He, on his side</l>
                    <l>Leaning half raised, with looks of cordial love</l>
                    <l>Hung over her enamoured, and beheld</l>
                    <l>Beauty, which, whether waking or asleep,</l>
                    <l>Shot forth peculiar graces; then with voice</l>
                    <l>Mild, as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes,</l>
                    <l>Her hand soft touching, whispered thus. Awake,</l>
                    <l>My fairest, my espoused, my latest found,</l>
                    <l>Heaven’s last best gift, my ever new delight!</l>
                    <l>Awake: The morning shines, and the fresh field</l>
                    <l>Calls us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring</l>
                    <l>Our tender plants, how blows the citron grove,</l>
                    <l>What drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed,</l>
                    <l>How nature paints her colours, how the bee</l>
                    <l>Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet.</l>
                    <l>Such whispering waked her, but with startled eye</l>
                    <l>On Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake.</l>
                    <l>O sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,</l>
                    <l>My glory, my perfection! glad I see</l>
                    <l>Thy face, and morn returned; for I this night</l>
                    <l>(Such night till this I never passed) have dreamed,</l>
                    <l>If dreamed, not, as I oft am wont, of thee,</l>
                    <l>Works of day past, or morrow’s next design,</l>
                    <l>But of offence and trouble, which my mind</l>
                    <l>Knew never till this irksome night: Methought,</l>
                    <l>Close at mine ear one called me forth to walk</l>
                    <l>With gentle voice; I thought it thine: It said,</l>
                    <l>“Why sleepest thou, Eve? now is the pleasant time,</l>
                    <l>The cool, the silent, save where silence yields</l>
                    <l>To the night-warbling bird, that now awake</l>
                    <l>Tunes sweetest his love-laboured song; now reigns</l>
                    <l>Full-orbed the moon, and with more pleasing light</l>
                    <l>Shadowy sets off the face of things; in vain,</l>
                    <l>If none regard; Heaven wakes with all his eyes,</l>
                    <l>Whom to behold but thee, Nature’s desire?</l>
                    <l>In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment</l>
                    <l>Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.”</l>
                    <l>I rose as at thy call, but found thee not;</l>
                    <l>To find thee I directed then my walk;</l>
                    <l>And on, methought, alone I passed through ways</l>
                    <l>That brought me on a sudden to the tree</l>
                    <l>Of interdicted knowledge: fair it seemed,</l>
                    <l>Much fairer to my fancy than by day:</l>
                    <l>And, as I wondering looked, beside it stood</l>
                    <l>One shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven</l>
                    <l>By us oft seen; his dewy locks distilled</l>
                    <l>Ambrosia; on that tree he also gazed;</l>
                    <l>And “O fair plant,” said he, “with fruit surcharged,</l>
                    <l>Deigns none to ease thy load, and taste thy sweet,</l>
                    <l>Nor God, nor Man? Is knowledge so despised?</l>
                    <l>Or envy, or what reserve forbids to taste?</l>
                    <l>Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold</l>
                    <l>Longer thy offered good; why else set here?”</l>
                    <l>This said, he paused not, but with venturous arm</l>
                    <l>He plucked, he tasted; me damp horrour chilled</l>
                    <l>At such bold words vouched with a deed so bold:</l>
                    <l>But he thus, overjoyed; “O fruit divine,</l>
                    <l>Sweet of thyself, but much more sweet thus cropt,</l>
                    <l>Forbidden here, it seems, as only fit</l>
                    <l>For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:</l>
                    <l>And why not Gods of Men; since good, the more</l>
                    <l>Communicated, more abundant grows,</l>
                    <l>The author not impaired, but honoured more?</l>
                    <l>Here, happy creature, fair angelick Eve!</l>
                    <l>Partake thou also; happy though thou art,</l>
                    <l>Happier thou mayest be, worthier canst not be:</l>
                    <l>Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods</l>
                    <l>Thyself a Goddess, not to earth confined,</l>
                    <l>But sometimes in the air, as we, sometimes</l>
                    <l>Ascend to Heaven, by merit thine, and see</l>
                    <l>What life the Gods live there, and such live thou!”</l>
                    <l>So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,</l>
                    <l>Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part</l>
                    <l>Which he had plucked; the pleasant savoury smell</l>
                    <l>So quickened appetite, that I, methought,</l>
                    <l>Could not but taste. Forthwith up to the clouds</l>
                    <l>With him I flew, and underneath beheld</l>
                    <l>The earth outstretched immense, a prospect wide</l>
                    <l>And various: Wondering at my flight and change</l>
                    <l>To this high exaltation; suddenly</l>
                    <l>My guide was gone, and I, methought, sunk down,</l>
                    <l>And fell asleep; but O, how glad I waked</l>
                    <l>To find this but a dream! Thus Eve her night</l>
                    <l>Related, and thus Adam answered sad.</l>
                    <l>Best image of myself, and dearer half,</l>
                    <l>The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep</l>
                    <l>Affects me equally; nor can I like</l>
                    <l>This uncouth dream, of evil sprung, I fear;</l>
                    <l>Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,</l>
                    <l>Created pure. But know that in the soul</l>
                    <l>Are many lesser faculties, that serve</l>
                    <l>Reason as chief; among these Fancy next</l>
                    <l>Her office holds; of all external things</l>
                    <l>Which the five watchful senses represent,</l>
                    <l>She forms imaginations, aery shapes,</l>
                    <l>Which Reason, joining or disjoining, frames</l>
                    <l>All what we affirm or what deny, and call</l>
                    <l>Our knowledge or opinion; then retires</l>
                    <l>Into her private cell, when nature rests.</l>
                    <l>Oft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes</l>
                    <l>To imitate her; but, misjoining shapes,</l>
                    <l>Wild work produces oft, and most in dreams;</l>
                    <l>Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.</l>
                    <l>Some such resemblances, methinks, I find</l>
                    <l>Of our last evening’s talk, in this thy dream,</l>
                    <l>But with addition strange; yet be not sad.</l>
                    <l>Evil into the mind of God or Man</l>
                    <l>May come and go, so unreproved, and leave</l>
                    <l>No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope</l>
                    <l>That what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream,</l>
                    <l>Waking thou never will consent to do.</l>
                    <l>Be not disheartened then, nor cloud those looks,</l>
                    <l>That wont to be more cheerful and serene,</l>
                    <l>Than when fair morning first smiles on the world;</l>
                    <l>And let us to our fresh employments rise</l>
                    <l>Among the groves, the fountains, and the flowers</l>
                    <l>That open now their choisest bosomed smells,</l>
                    <l>Reserved from night, and kept for thee in store.</l>
                    <l>So cheered he his fair spouse, and she was cheered;</l>
                    <l>But silently a gentle tear let fall</l>
                    <l>From either eye, and wiped them with her hair;</l>
                    <l>Two other precious drops that ready stood,</l>
                    <l>Each in their crystal sluice, he ere they fell</l>
                    <l>Kissed, as the gracious signs of sweet remorse</l>
                    <l>And pious awe, that feared to have offended.</l>
                    <l>So all was cleared, and to the field they haste.</l>
                    <l>But first, from under shady arborous roof</l>
                    <l>Soon as they forth were come to open sight</l>
                    <l>Of day-spring, and the sun, who, scarce up-risen,</l>
                    <l>With wheels yet hovering o’er the ocean-brim,</l>
                    <l>Shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray,</l>
                    <l>Discovering in wide landskip all the east</l>
                    <l>Of Paradise and Eden’s happy plains,</l>
                    <l>Lowly they bowed adoring, and began</l>
                    <l>Their orisons, each morning duly paid</l>
                    <l>In various style; for neither various style</l>
                    <l>Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise</l>
                    <l>Their Maker, in fit strains pronounced, or sung</l>
                    <l>Unmeditated; such prompt eloquence</l>
                    <l>Flowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse,</l>
                    <l>More tuneable than needed lute or harp</l>
                    <l>To add more sweetness; and they thus began.</l>
                    <l>These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,</l>
                    <l>Almighty! Thine this universal frame,</l>
                    <l>Thus wonderous fair; Thyself how wonderous then!</l>
                    <l>Unspeakable, who sitst above these heavens</l>
                    <l>To us invisible, or dimly seen</l>
                    <l>In these thy lowest works; yet these declare</l>
                    <l>Thy goodness beyond thought, and power divine.</l>
                    <l>Speak, ye who best can tell, ye sons of light,</l>
                    <l>Angels; for ye behold him, and with songs</l>
                    <l>And choral symphonies, day without night,</l>
                    <l>Circle his throne rejoicing; ye in Heaven</l>
                    <l>On Earth join all ye Creatures to extol</l>
                    <l>Him first, him last, him midst, and without end.</l>
                    <l>Fairest of stars, last in the train of night,</l>
                    <l>If better thou belong not to the dawn,</l>
                    <l>Sure pledge of day, that crownest the smiling morn</l>
                    <l>With thy bright circlet, praise him in thy sphere,</l>
                    <l>While day arises, that sweet hour of prime.</l>
                    <l>Thou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul,</l>
                    <l>Acknowledge him thy greater; sound his praise</l>
                    <l>In thy eternal course, both when thou climbest,</l>
                    <l>And when high noon hast gained, and when thou fallest.</l>
                    <l>Moon, that now meetest the orient sun, now flyest,</l>
                    <l>With the fixed Stars, fixed in their orb that flies;</l>
                    <l>And ye five other wandering Fires, that move</l>
                    <l>In mystick dance not without song, resound</l>
                    <l>His praise, who out of darkness called up light.</l>
                    <l>Air, and ye Elements, the eldest birth</l>
                    <l>Of Nature’s womb, that in quaternion run</l>
                    <l>Perpetual circle, multiform; and mix</l>
                    <l>And nourish all things; let your ceaseless change</l>
                    <l>Vary to our great Maker still new praise.</l>
                    <l>Ye Mists and Exhalations, that now rise</l>
                    <l>From hill or steaming lake, dusky or gray,</l>
                    <l>Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,</l>
                    <l>In honour to the world’s great Author rise;</l>
                    <l>Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky,</l>
                    <l>Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers,</l>
                    <l>Rising or falling still advance his praise.</l>
                    <l>His praise, ye Winds, that from four quarters blow,</l>
                    <l>Breathe soft or loud; and, wave your tops, ye Pines,</l>
                    <l>With every plant, in sign of worship wave.</l>
                    <l>Fountains, and ye that warble, as ye flow,</l>
                    <l>Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.</l>
                    <l>Join voices, all ye living Souls: Ye Birds,</l>
                    <l>That singing up to Heaven-gate ascend,</l>
                    <l>Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise.</l>
                    <l>Ye that in waters glide, and ye that walk</l>
                    <l>The earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;</l>
                    <l>Witness if I be silent, morn or even,</l>
                    <l>To hill, or valley, fountain, or fresh shade,</l>
                    <l>Made vocal by my song, and taught his praise.</l>
                    <l>Hail, universal Lord, be bounteous still</l>
                    <l>To give us only good; and if the night</l>
                    <l>Have gathered aught of evil, or concealed,</l>
                    <l>Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark!</l>
                    <l>So prayed they innocent, and to their thoughts</l>
                    <l>Firm peace recovered soon, and wonted calm.</l>
                    <l>On to their morning’s rural work they haste,</l>
                    <l>Among sweet dews and flowers; where any row</l>
                    <l>Of fruit-trees over-woody reached too far</l>
                    <l>Their pampered boughs, and needed hands to check</l>
                    <l>Fruitless embraces: or they led the vine</l>
                    <l>To wed her elm; she, spoused, about him twines</l>
                    <l>Her marriageable arms, and with him brings</l>
                    <l>Her dower, the adopted clusters, to adorn</l>
                    <l>His barren leaves. Them thus employed beheld</l>
                    <l>With pity Heaven’s high King, and to him called</l>
                    <l>Raphael, the sociable Spirit, that deigned</l>
                    <l>To travel with Tobias, and secured</l>
                    <l>His marriage with the seventimes-wedded maid.</l>
                    <l>Raphael, said he, thou hearest what stir on Earth</l>
                    <l>Satan, from Hell ’scaped through the darksome gulf,</l>
                    <l>Hath raised in Paradise; and how disturbed</l>
                    <l>This night the human pair; how he designs</l>
                    <l>In them at once to ruin all mankind.</l>
                    <l>Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend</l>
                    <l>Converse with Adam, in what bower or shade</l>
                    <l>Thou findest him from the heat of noon retired,</l>
                    <l>To respite his day-labour with repast,</l>
                    <l>Or with repose; and such discourse bring on,</l>
                    <l>As may advise him of his happy state,</l>
                    <l>Happiness in his power left free to will,</l>
                    <l>Left to his own free will, his will though free,</l>
                    <l>Yet mutable; whence warn him to beware</l>
                    <l>He swerve not, too secure: Tell him withal</l>
                    <l>His danger, and from whom; what enemy,</l>
                    <l>Late fallen himself from Heaven, is plotting now</l>
                    <l>The fall of others from like state of bliss;</l>
                    <l>By violence? no, for that shall be withstood;</l>
                    <l>But by deceit and lies: This let him know,</l>
                    <l>Lest, wilfully transgressing, he pretend</l>
                    <l>Surprisal, unadmonished, unforewarned.</l>
                    <l>So spake the Eternal Father, and fulfilled</l>
                    <l>All justice: Nor delayed the winged Saint</l>
                    <l>After his charge received; but from among</l>
                    <l>Thousand celestial Ardours, where he stood</l>
                    <l>Veiled with his gorgeous wings, up springing light,</l>
                    <l>Flew through the midst of Heaven; the angelick quires,</l>
                    <l>On each hand parting, to his speed gave way</l>
                    <l>Through all the empyreal road; till, at the gate</l>
                    <l>Of Heaven arrived, the gate self-opened wide</l>
                    <l>On golden hinges turning, as by work</l>
                    <l>Divine the sovran Architect had framed.</l>
                    <l>From hence no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,</l>
                    <l>Star interposed, however small he sees,</l>
                    <l>Not unconformed to other shining globes,</l>
                    <l>Earth, and the garden of God, with cedars crowned</l>
                    <l>Above all hills. As when by night the glass</l>
                    <l>Of Galileo, less assured, observes</l>
                    <l>Imagined lands and regions in the moon:</l>
                    <l>Or pilot, from amidst the Cyclades</l>
                    <l>Delos or Samos first appearing, kens</l>
                    <l>A cloudy spot. Down thither prone in flight</l>
                    <l>He speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky</l>
                    <l>Sails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing</l>
                    <l>Now on the polar winds, then with quick fan</l>
                    <l>Winnows the buxom air; till, within soar</l>
                    <l>Of towering eagles, to all the fowls he seems</l>
                    <l>A phoenix, gazed by all as that sole bird,</l>
                    <l>When, to enshrine his reliques in the Sun’s</l>
                    <l>Bright temple, to Egyptian Thebes he flies.</l>
                    <l>At once on the eastern cliff of Paradise</l>
                    <l>He lights, and to his proper shape returns</l>
                    <l>A Seraph winged: Six wings he wore, to shade</l>
                    <l>His lineaments divine; the pair that clad</l>
                    <l>Each shoulder broad, came mantling o’er his breast</l>
                    <l>With regal ornament; the middle pair</l>
                    <l>Girt like a starry zone his waist, and round</l>
                    <l>Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold</l>
                    <l>And colours dipt in Heaven; the third his feet</l>
                    <l>Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail,</l>
                    <l>Sky-tinctured grain. Like Maia’s son he stood,</l>
                    <l>And shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance filled</l>
                    <l>The circuit wide. Straight knew him all the bands</l>
                    <l>Of Angels under watch; and to his state,</l>
                    <l>And to his message high, in honour rise;</l>
                    <l>For on some message high they guessed him bound.</l>
                    <l>Their glittering tents he passed, and now is come</l>
                    <l>Into the blissful field, through groves of myrrh,</l>
                    <l>And flowering odours, cassia, nard, and balm;</l>
                    <l>A wilderness of sweets; for Nature here</l>
                    <l>Wantoned as in her prime, and played at will</l>
                    <l>Her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet,</l>
                    <l>Wild above rule or art, enormous bliss.</l>
                    <l>Him through the spicy forest onward come</l>
                    <l>Adam discerned, as in the door he sat</l>
                    <l>Of his cool bower, while now the mounted sun</l>
                    <l>Shot down direct his fervid rays to warm</l>
                    <l>Earth’s inmost womb, more warmth than Adam needs:</l>
                    <l>And Eve within, due at her hour prepared</l>
                    <l>For dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please</l>
                    <l>True appetite, and not disrelish thirst</l>
                    <l>Of nectarous draughts between, from milky stream,</l>
                    <l>Berry or grape: To whom thus Adam called.</l>
                    <l>Haste hither, Eve, and worth thy sight behold</l>
                    <l>Eastward among those trees, what glorious shape</l>
                    <l>Comes this way moving; seems another morn</l>
                    <l>Risen on mid-noon; some great behest from Heaven</l>
                    <l>To us perhaps he brings, and will vouchsafe</l>
                    <l>This day to be our guest. But go with speed,</l>
                    <l>And, what thy stores contain, bring forth, and pour</l>
                    <l>Abundance, fit to honour and receive</l>
                    <l>Our heavenly stranger: Well we may afford</l>
                    <l>Our givers their own gifts, and large bestow</l>
                    <l>From large bestowed, where Nature multiplies</l>
                    <l>Her fertile growth, and by disburthening grows</l>
                    <l>More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Eve. Adam, earth’s hallowed mould,</l>
                    <l>Of God inspired! small store will serve, where store,</l>
                    <l>All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;</l>
                    <l>Save what by frugal storing firmness gains</l>
                    <l>To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:</l>
                    <l>But I will haste, and from each bough and brake,</l>
                    <l>Each plant and juciest gourd, will pluck such choice</l>
                    <l>To entertain our Angel-guest, as he</l>
                    <l>Beholding shall confess, that here on Earth</l>
                    <l>God hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven.</l>
                    <l>So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste</l>
                    <l>She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent</l>
                    <l>What choice to choose for delicacy best,</l>
                    <l>What order, so contrived as not to mix</l>
                    <l>Tastes, not well joined, inelegant, but bring</l>
                    <l>Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change;</l>
                    <l>Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk</l>
                    <l>Whatever Earth, all-bearing mother, yields</l>
                    <l>In India East or West, or middle shore</l>
                    <l>In Pontus or the Punick coast, or where</l>
                    <l>Alcinous reigned, fruit of all kinds, in coat</l>
                    <l>Rough, or smooth rind, or bearded husk, or shell,</l>
                    <l>She gathers, tribute large, and on the board</l>
                    <l>Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the grape</l>
                    <l>She crushes, inoffensive must, and meaths</l>
                    <l>From many a berry, and from sweet kernels pressed</l>
                    <l>She tempers dulcet creams; nor these to hold</l>
                    <l>Wants her fit vessels pure; then strows the ground</l>
                    <l>With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed.</l>
                    <l>Mean while our primitive great sire, to meet</l>
                    <l>His God-like guest, walks forth, without more train</l>
                    <l>Accompanied than with his own complete</l>
                    <l>Perfections; in himself was all his state,</l>
                    <l>More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits</l>
                    <l>On princes, when their rich retinue long</l>
                    <l>Of horses led, and grooms besmeared with gold,</l>
                    <l>Dazzles the croud, and sets them all agape.</l>
                    <l>Nearer his presence Adam, though not awed,</l>
                    <l>Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek,</l>
                    <l>As to a superiour nature bowing low,</l>
                    <l>Thus said. Native of Heaven, for other place</l>
                    <l>None can than Heaven such glorious shape contain;</l>
                    <l>Since, by descending from the thrones above,</l>
                    <l>Those happy places thou hast deigned a while</l>
                    <l>To want, and honour these, vouchsafe with us</l>
                    <l>Two only, who yet by sovran gift possess</l>
                    <l>This spacious ground, in yonder shady bower</l>
                    <l>To rest; and what the garden choicest bears</l>
                    <l>To sit and taste, till this meridian heat</l>
                    <l>Be over, and the sun more cool decline.</l>
                    <l>Whom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild.</l>
                    <l>Adam, I therefore came; nor art thou such</l>
                    <l>Created, or such place hast here to dwell,</l>
                    <l>As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heaven,</l>
                    <l>To visit thee; lead on then where thy bower</l>
                    <l>O’ershades; for these mid-hours, till evening rise,</l>
                    <l>I have at will. So to the sylvan lodge</l>
                    <l>They came, that like Pomona’s arbour smiled,</l>
                    <l>With flowerets decked, and fragrant smells; but Eve,</l>
                    <l>Undecked save with herself, more lovely fair</l>
                    <l>Than Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feigned</l>
                    <l>Of three that in mount Ida naked strove,</l>
                    <l>Stood to entertain her guest from Heaven; no veil</l>
                    <l>She needed, virtue-proof; no thought infirm</l>
                    <l>Altered her cheek. On whom the Angel Hail</l>
                    <l>Bestowed, the holy salutation used</l>
                    <l>Long after to blest Mary, second Eve.</l>
                    <l>Hail, Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful womb</l>
                    <l>Shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons,</l>
                    <l>Than with these various fruits the trees of God</l>
                    <l>Have heaped this table!—Raised of grassy turf</l>
                    <l>Their table was, and mossy seats had round,</l>
                    <l>And on her ample square from side to side</l>
                    <l>All autumn piled, though spring and autumn here</l>
                    <l>Danced hand in hand. A while discourse they hold;</l>
                    <l>No fear lest dinner cool; when thus began</l>
                    <l>Our author. Heavenly stranger, please to taste</l>
                    <l>These bounties, which our Nourisher, from whom</l>
                    <l>All perfect good, unmeasured out, descends,</l>
                    <l>To us for food and for delight hath caused</l>
                    <l>The earth to yield; unsavoury food perhaps</l>
                    <l>To spiritual natures; only this I know,</l>
                    <l>That one celestial Father gives to all.</l>
                    <l>To whom the Angel. Therefore what he gives</l>
                    <l>(Whose praise be ever sung) to Man in part</l>
                    <l>Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found</l>
                    <l>No ingrateful food: And food alike those pure</l>
                    <l>Intelligential substances require,</l>
                    <l>As doth your rational; and both contain</l>
                    <l>Within them every lower faculty</l>
                    <l>Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,</l>
                    <l>Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate,</l>
                    <l>And corporeal to incorporeal turn.</l>
                    <l>For know, whatever was created, needs</l>
                    <l>To be sustained and fed: Of elements</l>
                    <l>The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,</l>
                    <l>Earth and the sea feed air, the air those fires</l>
                    <l>Ethereal, and as lowest first the moon;</l>
                    <l>Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurged</l>
                    <l>Vapours not yet into her substance turned.</l>
                    <l>Nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale</l>
                    <l>From her moist continent to higher orbs.</l>
                    <l>The sun that light imparts to all, receives</l>
                    <l>From all his alimental recompence</l>
                    <l>In humid exhalations, and at even</l>
                    <l>Sups with the ocean. Though in Heaven the trees</l>
                    <l>Of life ambrosial fruitage bear, and vines</l>
                    <l>Yield nectar; though from off the boughs each morn</l>
                    <l>We brush mellifluous dews, and find the ground</l>
                    <l>Covered with pearly grain: Yet God hath here</l>
                    <l>Varied his bounty so with new delights,</l>
                    <l>As may compare with Heaven; and to taste</l>
                    <l>Think not I shall be nice. So down they sat,</l>
                    <l>And to their viands fell; nor seemingly</l>
                    <l>The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss</l>
                    <l>Of Theologians; but with keen dispatch</l>
                    <l>Of real hunger, and concoctive heat</l>
                    <l>To transubstantiate: What redounds, transpires</l>
                    <l>Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire</l>
                    <l>Of sooty coal the empirick alchemist</l>
                    <l>Can turn, or holds it possible to turn,</l>
                    <l>Metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold,</l>
                    <l>As from the mine. Mean while at table Eve</l>
                    <l>Ministered naked, and their flowing cups</l>
                    <l>With pleasant liquours crowned: O innocence</l>
                    <l>Deserving Paradise! if ever, then,</l>
                    <l>Then had the sons of God excuse to have been</l>
                    <l>Enamoured at that sight; but in those hearts</l>
                    <l>Love unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy</l>
                    <l>Was understood, the injured lover’s hell.</l>
                    <l>Thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed,</l>
                    <l>Not burdened nature, sudden mind arose</l>
                    <l>In Adam, not to let the occasion pass</l>
                    <l>Given him by this great conference to know</l>
                    <l>Of things above his world, and of their being</l>
                    <l>Who dwell in Heaven, whose excellence he saw</l>
                    <l>Transcend his own so far; whose radiant forms,</l>
                    <l>Divine effulgence, whose high power, so far</l>
                    <l>Exceeded human; and his wary speech</l>
                    <l>Thus to the empyreal minister he framed.</l>
                    <l>Inhabitant with God, now know I well</l>
                    <l>Thy favour, in this honour done to Man;</l>
                    <l>Under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed</l>
                    <l>To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,</l>
                    <l>Food not of Angels, yet accepted so,</l>
                    <l>As that more willingly thou couldst not seem</l>
                    <l>At Heaven’s high feasts to have fed: yet what compare</l>
                    <l>To whom the winged Hierarch replied.</l>
                    <l>O Adam, One Almighty is, from whom</l>
                    <l>All things proceed, and up to him return,</l>
                    <l>If not depraved from good, created all</l>
                    <l>Such to perfection, one first matter all,</l>
                    <l>Endued with various forms, various degrees</l>
                    <l>Of substance, and, in things that live, of life;</l>
                    <l>But more refined, more spiritous, and pure,</l>
                    <l>As nearer to him placed, or nearer tending</l>
                    <l>Each in their several active spheres assigned,</l>
                    <l>Till body up to spirit work, in bounds</l>
                    <l>Proportioned to each kind. So from the root</l>
                    <l>Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves</l>
                    <l>More aery, last the bright consummate flower</l>
                    <l>Spirits odorous breathes: flowers and their fruit,</l>
                    <l>Man’s nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed,</l>
                    <l>To vital spirits aspire, to animal,</l>
                    <l>To intellectual; give both life and sense,</l>
                    <l>Fancy and understanding; whence the soul</l>
                    <l>Reason receives, and reason is her being,</l>
                    <l>Discursive, or intuitive; discourse</l>
                    <l>Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours,</l>
                    <l>Differing but in degree, of kind the same.</l>
                    <l>Wonder not then, what God for you saw good</l>
                    <l>If I refuse not, but convert, as you</l>
                    <l>To proper substance. Time may come, when Men</l>
                    <l>With Angels may participate, and find</l>
                    <l>No inconvenient diet, nor too light fare;</l>
                    <l>And from these corporal nutriments perhaps</l>
                    <l>Your bodies may at last turn all to spirit,</l>
                    <l>Improved by tract of time, and, winged, ascend</l>
                    <l>Ethereal, as we; or may, at choice,</l>
                    <l>Here or in heavenly Paradises dwell;</l>
                    <l>If ye be found obedient, and retain</l>
                    <l>Unalterably firm his love entire,</l>
                    <l>Whose progeny you are. Mean while enjoy</l>
                    <l>Your fill what happiness this happy state</l>
                    <l>Can comprehend, incapable of more.</l>
                    <l>To whom the patriarch of mankind replied.</l>
                    <l>O favourable Spirit, propitious guest,</l>
                    <l>Well hast thou taught the way that might direct</l>
                    <l>Our knowledge, and the scale of nature set</l>
                    <l>From center to circumference; whereon,</l>
                    <l>In contemplation of created things,</l>
                    <l>By steps we may ascend to God. But say,</l>
                    <l>What meant that caution joined, If ye be found</l>
                    <l>Obedient? Can we want obedience then</l>
                    <l>To him, or possibly his love desert,</l>
                    <l>Who formed us from the dust and placed us here</l>
                    <l>Full to the utmost measure of what bliss</l>
                    <l>Human desires can seek or apprehend?</l>
                    <l>To whom the Angel. Son of Heaven and Earth,</l>
                    <l>Attend! That thou art happy, owe to God;</l>
                    <l>That thou continuest such, owe to thyself,</l>
                    <l>That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.</l>
                    <l>This was that caution given thee; be advised.</l>
                    <l>God made thee perfect, not immutable;</l>
                    <l>And good he made thee, but to persevere</l>
                    <l>He left it in thy power; ordained thy will</l>
                    <l>By nature free, not over-ruled by fate</l>
                    <l>Inextricable, or strict necessity:</l>
                    <l>Our voluntary service he requires,</l>
                    <l>Not our necessitated; such with him</l>
                    <l>Finds no acceptance, nor can find; for how</l>
                    <l>Can hearts, not free, be tried whether they serve</l>
                    <l>Willing or no, who will but what they must</l>
                    <l>By destiny, and can no other choose?</l>
                    <l>Myself, and all the angelick host, that stand</l>
                    <l>In sight of God, enthroned, our happy state</l>
                    <l>Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;</l>
                    <l>On other surety none: Freely we serve,</l>
                    <l>Because we freely love, as in our will</l>
                    <l>To love or not; in this we stand or fall:</l>
                    <l>And some are fallen, to disobedience fallen,</l>
                    <l>And so from Heaven to deepest Hell; O fall</l>
                    <l>From what high state of bliss, into what woe!</l>
                    <l>To whom our great progenitor. Thy words</l>
                    <l>Attentive, and with more delighted ear,</l>
                    <l>Divine instructer, I have heard, than when</l>
                    <l>Cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills</l>
                    <l>Aereal musick send: Nor knew I not</l>
                    <l>To be both will and deed created free;</l>
                    <l>Yet that we never shall forget to love</l>
                    <l>Our Maker, and obey him whose command</l>
                    <l>Single is yet so just, my constant thoughts</l>
                    <l>Assured me, and still assure: Though what thou tellest</l>
                    <l>Hath passed in Heaven, some doubt within me move,</l>
                    <l>But more desire to hear, if thou consent,</l>
                    <l>The full relation, which must needs be strange,</l>
                    <l>Worthy of sacred silence to be heard;</l>
                    <l>And we have yet large day, for scarce the sun</l>
                    <l>Hath finished half his journey, and scarce begins</l>
                    <l>His other half in the great zone of Heaven.</l>
                    <l>Thus Adam made request; and Raphael,</l>
                    <l>After short pause assenting, thus began.</l>
                    <l>High matter thou enjoinest me, O prime of men,</l>
                    <l>Sad task and hard: For how shall I relate</l>
                    <l>To human sense the invisible exploits</l>
                    <l>Of warring Spirits? how, without remorse,</l>
                    <l>The ruin of so many glorious once</l>
                    <l>And perfect while they stood? how last unfold</l>
                    <l>The secrets of another world, perhaps</l>
                    <l>Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good</l>
                    <l>This is dispensed; and what surmounts the reach</l>
                    <l>Of human sense, I shall delineate so,</l>
                    <l>By likening spiritual to corporal forms,</l>
                    <l>As may express them best; though what if Earth</l>
                    <l>Be but a shadow of Heaven, and things therein</l>
                    <l>Each to other like, more than on earth is thought?</l>
                    <l>As yet this world was not, and Chaos wild</l>
                    <l>Reigned where these Heavens now roll, where Earth now rests</l>
                    <l>Upon her center poised; when on a day</l>
                    <l>(For time, though in eternity, applied</l>
                    <l>To motion, measures all things durable</l>
                    <l>By present, past, and future,) on such day</l>
                    <l>As Heaven’s great year brings forth, the empyreal host</l>
                    <l>Of Angels by imperial summons called,</l>
                    <l>Innumerable before the Almighty’s throne</l>
                    <l>Forthwith, from all the ends of Heaven, appeared</l>
                    <l>Under their Hierarchs in orders bright:</l>
                    <l>Ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced,</l>
                    <l>Standards and gonfalons ’twixt van and rear</l>
                    <l>Stream in the air, and for distinction serve</l>
                    <l>Of hierarchies, of orders, and degrees;</l>
                    <l>Or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed</l>
                    <l>Holy memorials, acts of zeal and love</l>
                    <l>Recorded eminent. Thus when in orbs</l>
                    <l>Of circuit inexpressible they stood,</l>
                    <l>Orb within orb, the Father Infinite,</l>
                    <l>By whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son,</l>
                    <l>Amidst as from a flaming mount, whose top</l>
                    <l>Brightness had made invisible, thus spake.</l>
                    <l>Hear, all ye Angels, progeny of light,</l>
                    <l>Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;</l>
                    <l>Hear my decree, which unrevoked shall stand.</l>
                    <l>This day I have begot whom I declare</l>
                    <l>My only Son, and on this holy hill</l>
                    <l>Him have anointed, whom ye now behold</l>
                    <l>At my right hand; your head I him appoint;</l>
                    <l>And by myself have sworn, to him shall bow</l>
                    <l>All knees in Heaven, and shall confess him Lord:</l>
                    <l>Under his great vice-gerent reign abide</l>
                    <l>United, as one individual soul,</l>
                    <l>For ever happy: Him who disobeys,</l>
                    <l>Me disobeys, breaks union, and that day,</l>
                    <l>Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls</l>
                    <l>Into utter darkness, deep ingulfed, his place</l>
                    <l>Ordained without redemption, without end.</l>
                    <l>So spake the Omnipotent, and with his words</l>
                    <l>All seemed well pleased; all seemed, but were not all.</l>
                    <l>That day, as other solemn days, they spent</l>
                    <l>In song and dance about the sacred hill;</l>
                    <l>Mystical dance, which yonder starry sphere</l>
                    <l>Of planets, and of fixed, in all her wheels</l>
                    <l>Resembles nearest, mazes intricate,</l>
                    <l>Eccentrick, intervolved, yet regular</l>
                    <l>Then most, when most irregular they seem;</l>
                    <l>And in their motions harmony divine</l>
                    <l>So smooths her charming tones, that God’s own ear</l>
                    <l>Listens delighted. Evening now approached,</l>
                    <l>(For we have also our evening and our morn,</l>
                    <l>We ours for change delectable, not need;)</l>
                    <l>Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn</l>
                    <l>Desirous; all in circles as they stood,</l>
                    <l>Tables are set, and on a sudden piled</l>
                    <l>With Angels food, and rubied nectar flows</l>
                    <l>In pearl, in diamond, and massy gold,</l>
                    <l>Fruit of delicious vines, the growth of Heaven.</l>
                    <l>On flowers reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned,</l>
                    <l>They eat, they drink, and in communion sweet</l>
                    <l>Quaff immortality and joy, secure</l>
                    <l>Of surfeit, where full measure only bounds</l>
                    <l>Excess, before the all-bounteous King, who showered</l>
                    <l>With copious hand, rejoicing in their joy.</l>
                    <l>Now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled</l>
                    <l>From that high mount of God, whence light and shade</l>
                    <l>Spring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed</l>
                    <l>To grateful twilight, (for night comes not there</l>
                    <l>In darker veil) and roseate dews disposed</l>
                    <l>All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest;</l>
                    <l>Wide over all the plain, and wider far</l>
                    <l>Than all this globous earth in plain outspread,</l>
                    <l>(Such are the courts of God) the angelick throng,</l>
                    <l>Dispersed in bands and files, their camp extend</l>
                    <l>By living streams among the trees of life,</l>
                    <l>Pavilions numberless, and sudden reared,</l>
                    <l>Celestial tabernacles, where they slept</l>
                    <l>Fanned with cool winds; save those, who, in their course,</l>
                    <l>Melodious hymns about the sovran throne</l>
                    <l>Alternate all night long: but not so waked</l>
                    <l>Satan; so call him now, his former name</l>
                    <l>Is heard no more in Heaven; he of the first,</l>
                    <l>If not the first Arch-Angel, great in power,</l>
                    <l>In favour and pre-eminence, yet fraught</l>
                    <l>With envy against the Son of God, that day</l>
                    <l>Honoured by his great Father, and proclaimed</l>
                    <l>Messiah King anointed, could not bear</l>
                    <l>Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaired.</l>
                    <l>Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain,</l>
                    <l>Soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour</l>
                    <l>Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolved</l>
                    <l>With all his legions to dislodge, and leave</l>
                    <l>Unworshipt, unobeyed, the throne supreme,</l>
                    <l>Contemptuous; and his next subordinate</l>
                    <l>Awakening, thus to him in secret spake.</l>
                    <l>Sleepest thou, Companion dear? What sleep can close</l>
                    <l>Thy eye-lids? and rememberest what decree</l>
                    <l>Of yesterday, so late hath passed the lips</l>
                    <l>Of Heaven’s Almighty. Thou to me thy thoughts</l>
                    <l>Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;</l>
                    <l>Both waking we were one; how then can now</l>
                    <l>Thy sleep dissent? New laws thou seest imposed;</l>
                    <l>New laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise</l>
                    <l>In us who serve, new counsels to debate</l>
                    <l>What doubtful may ensue: More in this place</l>
                    <l>To utter is not safe. Assemble thou</l>
                    <l>Of all those myriads which we lead the chief;</l>
                    <l>Tell them, that by command, ere yet dim night</l>
                    <l>Her shadowy cloud withdraws, I am to haste,</l>
                    <l>And all who under me their banners wave,</l>
                    <l>Homeward, with flying march, where we possess</l>
                    <l>The quarters of the north; there to prepare</l>
                    <l>Fit entertainment to receive our King,</l>
                    <l>The great Messiah, and his new commands,</l>
                    <l>Who speedily through all the hierarchies</l>
                    <l>Intends to pass triumphant, and give laws.</l>
                    <l>So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infused</l>
                    <l>Bad influence into the unwary breast</l>
                    <l>Of his associate: He together calls,</l>
                    <l>Or several one by one, the regent Powers,</l>
                    <l>Under him Regent; tells, as he was taught,</l>
                    <l>That the Most High commanding, now ere night,</l>
                    <l>Now ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven,</l>
                    <l>The great hierarchal standard was to move;</l>
                    <l>Tells the suggested cause, and casts between</l>
                    <l>Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound</l>
                    <l>Or taint integrity: But all obeyed</l>
                    <l>The wonted signal, and superiour voice</l>
                    <l>Of their great Potentate; for great indeed</l>
                    <l>His name, and high was his degree in Heaven;</l>
                    <l>His countenance, as the morning-star that guides</l>
                    <l>The starry flock, allured them, and with lies</l>
                    <l>Drew after him the third part of Heaven’s host.</l>
                    <l>Mean while the Eternal eye, whose sight discerns</l>
                    <l>Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy mount,</l>
                    <l>And from within the golden lamps that burn</l>
                    <l>Nightly before him, saw without their light</l>
                    <l>Rebellion rising; saw in whom, how spread</l>
                    <l>Among the sons of morn, what multitudes</l>
                    <l>Were banded to oppose his high decree;</l>
                    <l>And, smiling, to his only Son thus said.</l>
                    <l>Son, thou in whom my glory I behold</l>
                    <l>In full resplendence, Heir of all my might,</l>
                    <l>Nearly it now concerns us to be sure</l>
                    <l>Of our Omnipotence, and with what arms</l>
                    <l>We mean to hold what anciently we claim</l>
                    <l>Of deity or empire: Such a foe</l>
                    <l>Is rising, who intends to erect his throne</l>
                    <l>Equal to ours, throughout the spacious north;</l>
                    <l>Nor so content, hath in his thought to try</l>
                    <l>In battle, what our power is, or our right.</l>
                    <l>Let us advise, and to this hazard draw</l>
                    <l>With speed what force is left, and all employ</l>
                    <l>In our defence; lest unawares we lose</l>
                    <l>This our high place, our sanctuary, our hill.</l>
                    <l>To whom the Son with calm aspect and clear,</l>
                    <l>Lightning divine, ineffable, serene,</l>
                    <l>Made answer. Mighty Father, thou thy foes</l>
                    <l>Justly hast in derision, and, secure,</l>
                    <l>Laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain,</l>
                    <l>Matter to me of glory, whom their hate</l>
                    <l>Illustrates, when they see all regal power</l>
                    <l>Given me to quell their pride, and in event</l>
                    <l>Know whether I be dextrous to subdue</l>
                    <l>Thy rebels, or be found the worst in Heaven.</l>
                    <l>So spake the Son; but Satan, with his Powers,</l>
                    <l>Far was advanced on winged speed; an host</l>
                    <l>Innumerable as the stars of night,</l>
                    <l>Or stars of morning, dew-drops, which the sun</l>
                    <l>Impearls on every leaf and every flower.</l>
                    <l>Regions they passed, the mighty regencies</l>
                    <l>Of Seraphim, and Potentates, and Thrones,</l>
                    <l>In their triple degrees; regions to which</l>
                    <l>All thy dominion, Adam, is no more</l>
                    <l>Than what this garden is to all the earth,</l>
                    <l>And all the sea, from one entire globose</l>
                    <l>Stretched into longitude; which having passed,</l>
                    <l>At length into the limits of the north</l>
                    <l>They came; and Satan to his royal seat</l>
                    <l>High on a hill, far blazing, as a mount</l>
                    <l>Raised on a mount, with pyramids and towers</l>
                    <l>From diamond quarries hewn, and rocks of gold;</l>
                    <l>The palace of great Lucifer, (so call</l>
                    <l>That structure in the dialect of men</l>
                    <l>Interpreted,) which not long after, he</l>
                    <l>Affecting all equality with God,</l>
                    <l>In imitation of that mount whereon</l>
                    <l>Messiah was declared in sight of Heaven,</l>
                    <l>The Mountain of the Congregation called;</l>
                    <l>For thither he assembled all his train,</l>
                    <l>Pretending so commanded to consult</l>
                    <l>About the great reception of their King,</l>
                    <l>Thither to come, and with calumnious art</l>
                    <l>Of counterfeited truth thus held their ears.</l>
                    <l>Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;</l>
                    <l>If these magnifick titles yet remain</l>
                    <l>Not merely titular, since by decree</l>
                    <l>Another now hath to himself engrossed</l>
                    <l>All power, and us eclipsed under the name</l>
                    <l>Of King anointed, for whom all this haste</l>
                    <l>Of midnight-march, and hurried meeting here,</l>
                    <l>This only to consult how we may best,</l>
                    <l>With what may be devised of honours new,</l>
                    <l>Receive him coming to receive from us</l>
                    <l>Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile!</l>
                    <l>Too much to one! but double how endured,</l>
                    <l>To one, and to his image now proclaimed?</l>
                    <l>But what if better counsels might erect</l>
                    <l>Our minds, and teach us to cast off this yoke?</l>
                    <l>Will ye submit your necks, and choose to bend</l>
                    <l>The supple knee? Ye will not, if I trust</l>
                    <l>To know ye right, or if ye know yourselves</l>
                    <l>Natives and sons of Heaven possessed before</l>
                    <l>By none; and if not equal all, yet free,</l>
                    <l>Equally free; for orders and degrees</l>
                    <l>Jar not with liberty, but well consist.</l>
                    <l>Who can in reason then, or right, assume</l>
                    <l>Monarchy over such as live by right</l>
                    <l>His equals, if in power and splendour less,</l>
                    <l>In freedom equal? or can introduce</l>
                    <l>Law and edict on us, who without law</l>
                    <l>Err not? much less for this to be our Lord,</l>
                    <l>And look for adoration, to the abuse</l>
                    <l>Of those imperial titles, which assert</l>
                    <l>Our being ordained to govern, not to serve.</l>
                    <l>Thus far his bold discourse without controul</l>
                    <l>Had audience; when among the Seraphim</l>
                    <l>Abdiel, than whom none with more zeal adored</l>
                    <l>The Deity, and divine commands obeyed,</l>
                    <l>Stood up, and in a flame of zeal severe</l>
                    <l>The current of his fury thus opposed.</l>
                    <l>O argument blasphemous, false, and proud!</l>
                    <l>Words which no ear ever to hear in Heaven</l>
                    <l>Expected, least of all from thee, Ingrate,</l>
                    <l>In place thyself so high above thy peers.</l>
                    <l>Canst thou with impious obloquy condemn</l>
                    <l>The just decree of God, pronounced and sworn,</l>
                    <l>That to his only Son, by right endued</l>
                    <l>With regal scepter, every soul in Heaven</l>
                    <l>Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due</l>
                    <l>Confess him rightful King? unjust, thou sayest,</l>
                    <l>Flatly unjust, to bind with laws the free,</l>
                    <l>And equal over equals to let reign,</l>
                    <l>One over all with unsucceeded power.</l>
                    <l>Shalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute</l>
                    <l>With him the points of liberty, who made</l>
                    <l>Thee what thou art, and formed the Powers of Heaven</l>
                    <l>Such as he pleased, and circumscribed their being?</l>
                    <l>Yet, by experience taught, we know how good,</l>
                    <l>And of our good and of our dignity</l>
                    <l>How provident he is; how far from thought</l>
                    <l>To make us less, bent rather to exalt</l>
                    <l>Our happy state, under one head more near</l>
                    <l>United. But to grant it thee unjust,</l>
                    <l>That equal over equals monarch reign:</l>
                    <l>Thyself, though great and glorious, dost thou count,</l>
                    <l>Or all angelick nature joined in one,</l>
                    <l>Equal to him begotten Son? by whom,</l>
                    <l>As by his Word, the Mighty Father made</l>
                    <l>All things, even thee; and all the Spirits of Heaven</l>
                    <l>By him created in their bright degrees,</l>
                    <l>Crowned them with glory, and to their glory named</l>
                    <l>Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers,</l>
                    <l>Essential Powers; nor by his reign obscured,</l>
                    <l>But more illustrious made; since he the head</l>
                    <l>One of our number thus reduced becomes;</l>
                    <l>His laws our laws; all honour to him done</l>
                    <l>Returns our own. Cease then this impious rage,</l>
                    <l>And tempt not these; but hasten to appease</l>
                    <l>The incensed Father, and the incensed Son,</l>
                    <l>While pardon may be found in time besought.</l>
                    <l>So spake the fervent Angel; but his zeal</l>
                    <l>None seconded, as out of season judged,</l>
                    <l>Or singular and rash: Whereat rejoiced</l>
                    <l>The Apostate, and, more haughty, thus replied.</l>
                    <l>That we were formed then sayest thou? and the work</l>
                    <l>Of secondary hands, by task transferred</l>
                    <l>From Father to his Son? strange point and new!</l>
                    <l>Doctrine which we would know whence learned: who saw</l>
                    <l>When this creation was? rememberest thou</l>
                    <l>Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being?</l>
                    <l>We know no time when we were not as now;</l>
                    <l>Know none before us, self-begot, self-raised</l>
                    <l>By our own quickening power, when fatal course</l>
                    <l>Had circled his full orb, the birth mature</l>
                    <l>Of this our native Heaven, ethereal sons.</l>
                    <l>Our puissance is our own; our own right hand</l>
                    <l>Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try</l>
                    <l>Who is our equal: Then thou shalt behold</l>
                    <l>Whether by supplication we intend</l>
                    <l>Address, and to begirt the almighty throne</l>
                    <l>Beseeching or besieging. This report,</l>
                    <l>These tidings carry to the anointed King;</l>
                    <l>And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.</l>
                    <l>He said; and, as the sound of waters deep,</l>
                    <l>Hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause</l>
                    <l>Through the infinite host; nor less for that</l>
                    <l>The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone</l>
                    <l>Encompassed round with foes, thus answered bold.</l>
                    <l>O alienate from God, O Spirit accursed,</l>
                    <l>Forsaken of all good! I see thy fall</l>
                    <l>Determined, and thy hapless crew involved</l>
                    <l>In this perfidious fraud, contagion spread</l>
                    <l>Both of thy crime and punishment: Henceforth</l>
                    <l>No more be troubled how to quit the yoke</l>
                    <l>Of God’s Messiah; those indulgent laws</l>
                    <l>Will not be now vouchsafed; other decrees</l>
                    <l>Against thee are gone forth without recall;</l>
                    <l>That golden scepter, which thou didst reject,</l>
                    <l>Is now an iron rod to bruise and break</l>
                    <l>Thy disobedience. Well thou didst advise;</l>
                    <l>Yet not for thy advice or threats I fly</l>
                    <l>These wicked tents devoted, lest the wrath</l>
                    <l>Impendent, raging into sudden flame,</l>
                    <l>Distinguish not: For soon expect to feel</l>
                    <l>His thunder on thy head, devouring fire.</l>
                    <l>Then who created thee lamenting learn,</l>
                    <l>When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.</l>
                    <l>So spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found</l>
                    <l>Among the faithless, faithful only he;</l>
                    <l>Among innumerable false, unmoved,</l>
                    <l>Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified,</l>
                    <l>His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal;</l>
                    <l>Nor number, nor example, with him wrought</l>
                    <l>To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind,</l>
                    <l>Though single. From amidst them forth he passed,</l>
                    <l>Long way through hostile scorn, which he sustained</l>
                    <l>Superiour, nor of violence feared aught;</l>
                    <l>And, with retorted scorn, his back he turned</l>
                    <l>On those proud towers to swift destruction doomed.</l>

                    <l>All night the dreadless Angel, unpursued,</l>
                    <l>Through Heaven’s wide champain held his way; till Morn,</l>
                    <l>Waked by the circling Hours, with rosy hand</l>
                    <l>Unbarred the gates of light. There is a cave</l>
                    <l>Within the mount of God, fast by his throne,</l>
                    <l>Where light and darkness in perpetual round</l>
                    <l>Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heaven</l>
                    <l>Grateful vicissitude, like day and night;</l>
                    <l>Light issues forth, and at the other door</l>
                    <l>Obsequious darkness enters, till her hour</l>
                    <l>To veil the Heaven, though darkness there might well</l>
                    <l>Seem twilight here: And now went forth the Morn</l>
                    <l>Such as in highest Heaven arrayed in gold</l>
                    <l>Empyreal; from before her vanished Night,</l>
                    <l>Shot through with orient beams; when all the plain</l>
                    <l>Covered with thick embattled squadrons bright,</l>
                    <l>Chariots, and flaming arms, and fiery steeds,</l>
                    <l>Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:</l>
                    <l>War he perceived, war in procinct; and found</l>
                    <l>Already known what he for news had thought</l>
                    <l>To have reported: Gladly then he mixed</l>
                    <l>Among those friendly Powers, who him received</l>
                    <l>With joy and acclamations loud, that one,</l>
                    <l>That of so many myriads fallen, yet one</l>
                    <l>Returned not lost. On to the sacred hill</l>
                    <l>They led him high applauded, and present</l>
                    <l>Before the seat supreme; from whence a voice,</l>
                    <l>From midst a golden cloud, thus mild was heard.</l>
                    <l>Servant of God. Well done; well hast thou fought</l>
                    <l>The better fight, who single hast maintained</l>
                    <l>Against revolted multitudes the cause</l>
                    <l>Of truth, in word mightier than they in arms;</l>
                    <l>And for the testimony of truth hast borne</l>
                    <l>Universal reproach, far worse to bear</l>
                    <l>Than violence; for this was all thy care</l>
                    <l>To stand approved in sight of God, though worlds</l>
                    <l>Judged thee perverse: The easier conquest now</l>
                    <l>Remains thee, aided by this host of friends,</l>
                    <l>Back on thy foes more glorious to return,</l>
                    <l>Than scorned thou didst depart; and to subdue</l>
                    <l>By force, who reason for their law refuse,</l>
                    <l>Right reason for their law, and for their King</l>
                    <l>Messiah, who by right of merit reigns.</l>
                    <l>Go, Michael, of celestial armies prince,</l>
                    <l>And thou, in military prowess next,</l>
                    <l>Gabriel, lead forth to battle these my sons</l>
                    <l>Invincible; lead forth my armed Saints,</l>
                    <l>By thousands and by millions, ranged for fight,</l>
                    <l>Equal in number to that Godless crew</l>
                    <l>Rebellious: Them with fire and hostile arms</l>
                    <l>Fearless assault; and, to the brow of Heaven</l>
                    <l>Pursuing, drive them out from God and bliss,</l>
                    <l>Into their place of punishment, the gulf</l>
                    <l>Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide</l>
                    <l>His fiery Chaos to receive their fall.</l>
                    <l>So spake the Sovran Voice, and clouds began</l>
                    <l>To darken all the hill, and smoke to roll</l>
                    <l>In dusky wreaths, reluctant flames, the sign</l>
                    <l>Of wrath awaked; nor with less dread the loud</l>
                    <l>Ethereal trumpet from on high ’gan blow:</l>
                    <l>At which command the Powers militant,</l>
                    <l>That stood for Heaven, in mighty quadrate joined</l>
                    <l>Of union irresistible, moved on</l>
                    <l>In silence their bright legions, to the sound</l>
                    <l>Of instrumental harmony, that breathed</l>
                    <l>Heroick ardour to adventurous deeds</l>
                    <l>Under their God-like leaders, in the cause</l>
                    <l>Of God and his Messiah. On they move</l>
                    <l>Indissolubly firm; nor obvious hill,</l>
                    <l>Nor straitening vale, nor wood, nor stream, divides</l>
                    <l>Their perfect ranks; for high above the ground</l>
                    <l>Their march was, and the passive air upbore</l>
                    <l>Their nimble tread; as when the total kind</l>
                    <l>Of birds, in orderly array on wing,</l>
                    <l>Came summoned over Eden to receive</l>
                    <l>Their names of thee; so over many a tract</l>
                    <l>Of Heaven they marched, and many a province wide,</l>
                    <l>Tenfold the length of this terrene: At last,</l>
                    <l>Far in the horizon to the north appeared</l>
                    <l>From skirt to skirt a fiery region, stretched</l>
                    <l>In battailous aspect, and nearer view</l>
                    <l>Bristled with upright beams innumerable</l>
                    <l>Of rigid spears, and helmets thronged, and shields</l>
                    <l>Various, with boastful argument portrayed,</l>
                    <l>The banded Powers of Satan hasting on</l>
                    <l>With furious expedition; for they weened</l>
                    <l>That self-same day, by fight or by surprise,</l>
                    <l>To win the mount of God, and on his throne</l>
                    <l>To set the Envier of his state, the proud</l>
                    <l>Aspirer; but their thoughts proved fond and vain</l>
                    <l>In the mid way: Though strange to us it seemed</l>
                    <l>At first, that Angel should with Angel war,</l>
                    <l>And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet</l>
                    <l>So oft in festivals of joy and love</l>
                    <l>Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire,</l>
                    <l>Hymning the Eternal Father: But the shout</l>
                    <l>Of battle now began, and rushing sound</l>
                    <l>Of onset ended soon each milder thought.</l>
                    <l>High in the midst, exalted as a God,</l>
                    <l>The Apostate in his sun-bright chariot sat,</l>
                    <l>Idol of majesty divine, enclosed</l>
                    <l>With flaming Cherubim, and golden shields;</l>
                    <l>Then lighted from his gorgeous throne, for now</l>
                    <l>’Twixt host and host but narrow space was left,</l>
                    <l>A dreadful interval, and front to front</l>
                    <l>Presented stood in terrible array</l>
                    <l>Of hideous length: Before the cloudy van,</l>
                    <l>On the rough edge of battle ere it joined,</l>
                    <l>Satan, with vast and haughty strides advanced,</l>
                    <l>Came towering, armed in adamant and gold;</l>
                    <l>Abdiel that sight endured not, where he stood</l>
                    <l>Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,</l>
                    <l>And thus his own undaunted heart explores.</l>
                    <l>O Heaven! that such resemblance of the Highest</l>
                    <l>Should yet remain, where faith and realty</l>
                    <l>Remain not: Wherefore should not strength and might</l>
                    <l>There fail where virtue fails, or weakest prove</l>
                    <l>Where boldest, though to fight unconquerable?</l>
                    <l>His puissance, trusting in the Almighty’s aid,</l>
                    <l>I mean to try, whose reason I have tried</l>
                    <l>Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just,</l>
                    <l>That he, who in debate of truth hath won,</l>
                    <l>Should win in arms, in both disputes alike</l>
                    <l>Victor; though brutish that contest and foul,</l>
                    <l>When reason hath to deal with force, yet so</l>
                    <l>Most reason is that reason overcome.</l>
                    <l>So pondering, and from his armed peers</l>
                    <l>Forth stepping opposite, half-way he met</l>
                    <l>His daring foe, at this prevention more</l>
                    <l>Incensed, and thus securely him defied.</l>
                    <l>Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reached</l>
                    <l>The highth of thy aspiring unopposed,</l>
                    <l>The throne of God unguarded, and his side</l>
                    <l>Abandoned, at the terrour of thy power</l>
                    <l>Or potent tongue: Fool! not to think how vain</l>
                    <l>Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms;</l>
                    <l>Who out of smallest things could, without end,</l>
                    <l>Have raised incessant armies to defeat</l>
                    <l>Thy folly; or with solitary hand</l>
                    <l>Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow,</l>
                    <l>Unaided, could have finished thee, and whelmed</l>
                    <l>Thy legions under darkness: But thou seest</l>
                    <l>All are not of thy train; there be, who faith</l>
                    <l>Prefer, and piety to God, though then</l>
                    <l>To thee not visible, when I alone</l>
                    <l>Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent</l>
                    <l>From all: My sect thou seest; now learn too late</l>
                    <l>How few sometimes may know, when thousands err.</l>
                    <l>Whom the grand foe, with scornful eye askance,</l>
                    <l>Thus answered. Ill for thee, but in wished hour</l>
                    <l>Of my revenge, first sought for, thou returnest</l>
                    <l>From flight, seditious Angel! to receive</l>
                    <l>Thy merited reward, the first assay</l>
                    <l>Of this right hand provoked, since first that tongue,</l>
                    <l>Inspired with contradiction, durst oppose</l>
                    <l>A third part of the Gods, in synod met</l>
                    <l>Their deities to assert; who, while they feel</l>
                    <l>Vigour divine within them, can allow</l>
                    <l>Omnipotence to none. But well thou comest</l>
                    <l>Before thy fellows, ambitious to win</l>
                    <l>From me some plume, that thy success may show</l>
                    <l>Destruction to the rest: This pause between,</l>
                    <l>(Unanswered lest thou boast) to let thee know,</l>
                    <l>At first I thought that Liberty and Heaven</l>
                    <l>To heavenly souls had been all one; but now</l>
                    <l>I see that most through sloth had rather serve,</l>
                    <l>Ministring Spirits, trained up in feast and song!</l>
                    <l>Such hast thou armed, the minstrelsy of Heaven,</l>
                    <l>Servility with freedom to contend,</l>
                    <l>As both their deeds compared this day shall prove.</l>
                    <l>To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied.</l>
                    <l>Apostate! still thou errest, nor end wilt find</l>
                    <l>Of erring, from the path of truth remote:</l>
                    <l>Unjustly thou depravest it with the name</l>
                    <l>Of servitude, to serve whom God ordains,</l>
                    <l>Or Nature: God and Nature bid the same,</l>
                    <l>When he who rules is worthiest, and excels</l>
                    <l>Them whom he governs. This is servitude,</l>
                    <l>To serve the unwise, or him who hath rebelled</l>
                    <l>Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,</l>
                    <l>Thyself not free, but to thyself enthralled;</l>
                    <l>Yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid.</l>
                    <l>Reign thou in Hell, thy kingdom; let me serve</l>
                    <l>In Heaven God ever blest, and his divine</l>
                    <l>Behests obey, worthiest to be obeyed;</l>
                    <l>Yet chains in Hell, not realms, expect: Mean while</l>
                    <l>From me returned, as erst thou saidst, from flight,</l>
                    <l>This greeting on thy impious crest receive.</l>
                    <l>So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,</l>
                    <l>Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell</l>
                    <l>On the proud crest of Satan, that no sight,</l>
                    <l>Nor motion of swift thought, less could his shield,</l>
                    <l>Such ruin intercept: Ten paces huge</l>
                    <l>He back recoiled; the tenth on bended knee</l>
                    <l>His massy spear upstaid; as if on earth</l>
                    <l>Winds under ground, or waters forcing way,</l>
                    <l>Sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat,</l>
                    <l>Half sunk with all his pines. Amazement seised</l>
                    <l>The rebel Thrones, but greater rage, to see</l>
                    <l>Thus foiled their mightiest; ours joy filled, and shout,</l>
                    <l>Presage of victory, and fierce desire</l>
                    <l>Of battle: Whereat Michael bid sound</l>
                    <l>The Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven</l>
                    <l>It sounded, and the faithful armies rung</l>
                    <l>Hosanna to the Highest: Nor stood at gaze</l>
                    <l>The adverse legions, nor less hideous joined</l>
                    <l>The horrid shock. Now storming fury rose,</l>
                    <l>And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now</l>
                    <l>Was never; arms on armour clashing brayed</l>
                    <l>Horrible discord, and the madding wheels</l>
                    <l>Of brazen chariots raged; dire was the noise</l>
                    <l>Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss</l>
                    <l>Of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew,</l>
                    <l>And flying vaulted either host with fire.</l>
                    <l>So under fiery cope together rushed</l>
                    <l>Both battles main, with ruinous assault</l>
                    <l>And inextinguishable rage. All Heaven</l>
                    <l>Resounded; and had Earth been then, all Earth</l>
                    <l>Had to her center shook. What wonder? when</l>
                    <l>Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought</l>
                    <l>On either side, the least of whom could wield</l>
                    <l>These elements, and arm him with the force</l>
                    <l>Of all their regions: How much more of power</l>
                    <l>Army against army numberless to raise</l>
                    <l>Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,</l>
                    <l>Though not destroy, their happy native seat;</l>
                    <l>Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent,</l>
                    <l>From his strong hold of Heaven, high over-ruled</l>
                    <l>And limited their might; though numbered such</l>
                    <l>As each divided legion might have seemed</l>
                    <l>A numerous host; in strength each armed hand</l>
                    <l>A legion; led in fight, yet leader seemed</l>
                    <l>Each warriour single as in chief, expert</l>
                    <l>When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway</l>
                    <l>Of battle, open when, and when to close</l>
                    <l>The ridges of grim war: No thought of flight,</l>
                    <l>None of retreat, no unbecoming deed</l>
                    <l>That argued fear; each on himself relied,</l>
                    <l>As only in his arm the moment lay</l>
                    <l>Of victory: Deeds of eternal fame</l>
                    <l>Were done, but infinite; for wide was spread</l>
                    <l>That war and various; sometimes on firm ground</l>
                    <l>A standing fight, then, soaring on main wing,</l>
                    <l>Tormented all the air; all air seemed then</l>
                    <l>Conflicting fire. Long time in even scale</l>
                    <l>The battle hung; till Satan, who that day</l>
                    <l>Prodigious power had shown, and met in arms</l>
                    <l>No equal, ranging through the dire attack</l>
                    <l>Of fighting Seraphim confused, at length</l>
                    <l>Saw where the sword of Michael smote, and felled</l>
                    <l>Squadrons at once; with huge two-handed sway</l>
                    <l>Brandished aloft, the horrid edge came down</l>
                    <l>Wide-wasting; such destruction to withstand</l>
                    <l>He hasted, and opposed the rocky orb</l>
                    <l>Of tenfold adamant, his ample shield,</l>
                    <l>A vast circumference. At his approach</l>
                    <l>The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toil</l>
                    <l>Surceased, and glad, as hoping here to end</l>
                    <l>Intestine war in Heaven, the arch-foe subdued</l>
                    <l>Or captive dragged in chains, with hostile frown</l>
                    <l>And visage all inflamed first thus began.</l>
                    <l>Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt,</l>
                    <l>Unnamed in Heaven, now plenteous as thou seest</l>
                    <l>These acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,</l>
                    <l>Though heaviest by just measure on thyself,</l>
                    <l>And thy adherents: How hast thou disturbed</l>
                    <l>Heaven’s blessed peace, and into nature brought</l>
                    <l>Misery, uncreated till the crime</l>
                    <l>Of thy rebellion! how hast thou instilled</l>
                    <l>Thy malice into thousands, once upright</l>
                    <l>And faithful, now proved false! But think not here</l>
                    <l>To trouble holy rest; Heaven casts thee out</l>
                    <l>From all her confines. Heaven, the seat of bliss,</l>
                    <l>Brooks not the works of violence and war.</l>
                    <l>Hence then, and evil go with thee along,</l>
                    <l>Thy offspring, to the place of evil, Hell;</l>
                    <l>Thou and thy wicked crew! there mingle broils,</l>
                    <l>Ere this avenging sword begin thy doom,</l>
                    <l>Or some more sudden vengeance, winged from God,</l>
                    <l>Precipitate thee with augmented pain.</l>
                    <l>So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus</l>
                    <l>The Adversary. Nor think thou with wind</l>
                    <l>Of aery threats to awe whom yet with deeds</l>
                    <l>Thou canst not. Hast thou turned the least of these</l>
                    <l>To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise</l>
                    <l>Unvanquished, easier to transact with me</l>
                    <l>That thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats</l>
                    <l>To chase me hence? err not, that so shall end</l>
                    <l>The strife which thou callest evil, but we style</l>
                    <l>The strife of glory; which we mean to win,</l>
                    <l>Or turn this Heaven itself into the Hell</l>
                    <l>Thou fablest; here however to dwell free,</l>
                    <l>If not to reign: Mean while thy utmost force,</l>
                    <l>And join him named Almighty to thy aid,</l>
                    <l>I fly not, but have sought thee far and nigh.</l>
                    <l>They ended parle, and both addressed for fight</l>
                    <l>Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue</l>
                    <l>Of Angels, can relate, or to what things</l>
                    <l>Liken on earth conspicuous, that may lift</l>
                    <l>Human imagination to such highth</l>
                    <l>Of Godlike power? for likest Gods they seemed,</l>
                    <l>Stood they or moved, in stature, motion, arms,</l>
                    <l>Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven.</l>
                    <l>Now waved their fiery swords, and in the air</l>
                    <l>Made horrid circles; two broad suns their shields</l>
                    <l>Blazed opposite, while Expectation stood</l>
                    <l>In horrour: From each hand with speed retired,</l>
                    <l>Where erst was thickest fight, the angelick throng,</l>
                    <l>And left large field, unsafe within the wind</l>
                    <l>Of such commotion; such as, to set forth</l>
                    <l>Great things by small, if, nature’s concord broke,</l>
                    <l>Among the constellations war were sprung,</l>
                    <l>Two planets, rushing from aspect malign</l>
                    <l>Of fiercest opposition, in mid sky</l>
                    <l>Should combat, and their jarring spheres confound.</l>
                    <l>Together both with next to almighty arm</l>
                    <l>Up-lifted imminent, one stroke they aimed</l>
                    <l>That might determine, and not need repeat,</l>
                    <l>As not of power at once; nor odds appeared</l>
                    <l>In might or swift prevention: But the sword</l>
                    <l>Of Michael from the armoury of God</l>
                    <l>Was given him tempered so, that neither keen</l>
                    <l>Nor solid might resist that edge: it met</l>
                    <l>The sword of Satan, with steep force to smite</l>
                    <l>Descending, and in half cut sheer; nor staid,</l>
                    <l>But with swift wheel reverse, deep entering, shared</l>
                    <l>All his right side: Then Satan first knew pain,</l>
                    <l>And writhed him to and fro convolved; so sore</l>
                    <l>The griding sword with discontinuous wound</l>
                    <l>Passed through him: But the ethereal substance closed,</l>
                    <l>Not long divisible; and from the gash</l>
                    <l>A stream of necturous humour issuing flowed</l>
                    <l>Sanguine, such as celestial Spirits may bleed,</l>
                    <l>And all his armour stained, ere while so bright.</l>
                    <l>Forthwith on all sides to his aid was run</l>
                    <l>By Angels many and strong, who interposed</l>
                    <l>Defence, while others bore him on their shields</l>
                    <l>Back to his chariot, where it stood retired</l>
                    <l>From off the files of war: There they him laid</l>
                    <l>Gnashing for anguish, and despite, and shame,</l>
                    <l>To find himself not matchless, and his pride</l>
                    <l>Humbled by such rebuke, so far beneath</l>
                    <l>His confidence to equal God in power.</l>
                    <l>Yet soon he healed; for Spirits that live throughout</l>
                    <l>Vital in every part, not as frail man</l>
                    <l>In entrails, heart of head, liver or reins,</l>
                    <l>Cannot but by annihilating die;</l>
                    <l>Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound</l>
                    <l>Receive, no more than can the fluid air:</l>
                    <l>All heart they live, all head, all eye, all ear,</l>
                    <l>All intellect, all sense; and, as they please,</l>
                    <l>They limb themselves, and colour, shape, or size</l>
                    <l>Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare.</l>
                    <l>Mean while in other parts like deeds deserved</l>
                    <l>Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought,</l>
                    <l>And with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array</l>
                    <l>Of Moloch, furious king; who him defied,</l>
                    <l>And at his chariot-wheels to drag him bound</l>
                    <l>Threatened, nor from the Holy One of Heaven</l>
                    <l>Refrained his tongue blasphemous; but anon</l>
                    <l>Down cloven to the waist, with shattered arms</l>
                    <l>And uncouth pain fled bellowing. On each wing</l>
                    <l>Uriel, and Raphael, his vaunting foe,</l>
                    <l>Though huge, and in a rock of diamond armed,</l>
                    <l>Vanquished Adramelech, and Asmadai,</l>
                    <l>Two potent Thrones, that to be less than Gods</l>
                    <l>Disdained, but meaner thoughts learned in their flight,</l>
                    <l>Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail.</l>
                    <l>Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy</l>
                    <l>The atheist crew, but with redoubled blow</l>
                    <l>Ariel, and Arioch, and the violence</l>
                    <l>Of Ramiel scorched and blasted, overthrew.</l>
                    <l>I might relate of thousands, and their names</l>
                    <l>Eternize here on earth; but those elect</l>
                    <l>Angels, contented with their fame in Heaven,</l>
                    <l>Seek not the praise of men: The other sort,</l>
                    <l>In might though wonderous and in acts of war,</l>
                    <l>Nor of renown less eager, yet by doom</l>
                    <l>Cancelled from Heaven and sacred memory,</l>
                    <l>Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.</l>
                    <l>For strength from truth divided, and from just,</l>
                    <l>Illaudable, nought merits but dispraise</l>
                    <l>And ignominy; yet to glory aspires</l>
                    <l>Vain-glorious, and through infamy seeks fame:</l>
                    <l>Therefore eternal silence be their doom.</l>
                    <l>And now, their mightiest quelled, the battle swerved,</l>
                    <l>With many an inroad gored; deformed rout</l>
                    <l>Entered, and foul disorder; all the ground</l>
                    <l>With shivered armour strown, and on a heap</l>
                    <l>Chariot and charioteer lay overturned,</l>
                    <l>And fiery-foaming steeds; what stood, recoiled</l>
                    <l>O’er-wearied, through the faint Satanick host</l>
                    <l>Defensive scarce, or with pale fear surprised,</l>
                    <l>Then first with fear surprised, and sense of pain,</l>
                    <l>Fled ignominious, to such evil brought</l>
                    <l>By sin of disobedience; till that hour</l>
                    <l>Not liable to fear, or flight, or pain.</l>
                    <l>Far otherwise the inviolable Saints,</l>
                    <l>In cubick phalanx firm, advanced entire,</l>
                    <l>Invulnerable, impenetrably armed;</l>
                    <l>Such high advantages their innocence</l>
                    <l>Gave them above their foes; not to have sinned,</l>
                    <l>Not to have disobeyed; in fight they stood</l>
                    <l>Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pained</l>
                    <l>By wound, though from their place by violence moved,</l>
                    <l>Now Night her course began, and, over Heaven</l>
                    <l>Inducing darkness, grateful truce imposed,</l>
                    <l>And silence on the odious din of war:</l>
                    <l>Under her cloudy covert both retired,</l>
                    <l>Victor and vanquished: On the foughten field</l>
                    <l>Michael and his Angels prevalent</l>
                    <l>Encamping, placed in guard their watches round,</l>
                    <l>Cherubick waving fires: On the other part,</l>
                    <l>Satan with his rebellious disappeared,</l>
                    <l>Far in the dark dislodged; and, void of rest,</l>
                    <l>His potentates to council called by night;</l>
                    <l>And in the midst thus undismayed began.</l>
                    <l>O now in danger tried, now known in arms</l>
                    <l>Not to be overpowered, Companions dear,</l>
                    <l>Found worthy not of liberty alone,</l>
                    <l>Too mean pretence! but what we more affect,</l>
                    <l>Honour, dominion, glory, and renown;</l>
                    <l>Who have sustained one day in doubtful fight,</l>
                    <l>(And if one day, why not eternal days?)</l>
                    <l>What Heaven’s Lord had powerfullest to send</l>
                    <l>Against us from about his throne, and judged</l>
                    <l>Sufficient to subdue us to his will,</l>
                    <l>But proves not so: Then fallible, it seems,</l>
                    <l>Of future we may deem him, though till now</l>
                    <l>Omniscient thought. True is, less firmly armed,</l>
                    <l>Some disadvantage we endured and pain,</l>
                    <l>Till now not known, but, known, as soon contemned;</l>
                    <l>Since now we find this our empyreal form</l>
                    <l>Incapable of mortal injury,</l>
                    <l>Imperishable, and, though pierced with wound,</l>
                    <l>Soon closing, and by native vigour healed.</l>
                    <l>Of evil then so small as easy think</l>
                    <l>The remedy; perhaps more valid arms,</l>
                    <l>Weapons more violent, when next we meet,</l>
                    <l>May serve to better us, and worse our foes,</l>
                    <l>Or equal what between us made the odds,</l>
                    <l>In nature none: If other hidden cause</l>
                    <l>Left them superiour, while we can preserve</l>
                    <l>Unhurt our minds, and understanding sound,</l>
                    <l>Due search and consultation will disclose.</l>
                    <l>He sat; and in the assembly next upstood</l>
                    <l>Nisroch, of Principalities the prime;</l>
                    <l>As one he stood escaped from cruel fight,</l>
                    <l>Sore toiled, his riven arms to havock hewn,</l>
                    <l>And cloudy in aspect thus answering spake.</l>
                    <l>Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free</l>
                    <l>Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard</l>
                    <l>For Gods, and too unequal work we find,</l>
                    <l>Against unequal arms to fight in pain,</l>
                    <l>Against unpained, impassive; from which evil</l>
                    <l>Ruin must needs ensue; for what avails</l>
                    <l>Valour or strength, though matchless, quelled with pain</l>
                    <l>Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands</l>
                    <l>Of mightiest? Sense of pleasure we may well</l>
                    <l>Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine,</l>
                    <l>But live content, which is the calmest life:</l>
                    <l>But pain is perfect misery, the worst</l>
                    <l>Of evils, and, excessive, overturns</l>
                    <l>All patience. He, who therefore can invent</l>
                    <l>With what more forcible we may offend</l>
                    <l>Our yet unwounded enemies, or arm</l>
                    <l>Ourselves with like defence, to me deserves</l>
                    <l>No less than for deliverance what we owe.</l>
                    <l>Whereto with look composed Satan replied.</l>
                    <l>Not uninvented that, which thou aright</l>
                    <l>Believest so main to our success, I bring.</l>
                    <l>Which of us who beholds the bright surface</l>
                    <l>Of this ethereous mould whereon we stand,</l>
                    <l>This continent of spacious Heaven, adorned</l>
                    <l>With plant, fruit, flower ambrosial, gems, and gold;</l>
                    <l>Whose eye so superficially surveys</l>
                    <l>These things, as not to mind from whence they grow</l>
                    <l>Deep under ground, materials dark and crude,</l>
                    <l>Of spiritous and fiery spume, till touched</l>
                    <l>With Heaven’s ray, and tempered, they shoot forth</l>
                    <l>So beauteous, opening to the ambient light?</l>
                    <l>These in their dark nativity the deep</l>
                    <l>Shall yield us, pregnant with infernal flame;</l>
                    <l>Which, into hollow engines, long and round,</l>
                    <l>Thick rammed, at the other bore with touch of fire</l>
                    <l>Dilated and infuriate, shall send forth</l>
                    <l>From far, with thundering noise, among our foes</l>
                    <l>Such implements of mischief, as shall dash</l>
                    <l>To pieces, and o’erwhelm whatever stands</l>
                    <l>Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmed</l>
                    <l>The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.</l>
                    <l>Nor long shall be our labour; yet ere dawn,</l>
                    <l>Effect shall end our wish. Mean while revive;</l>
                    <l>Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joined</l>
                    <l>Think nothing hard, much less to be despaired.</l>
                    <l>He ended, and his words their drooping cheer</l>
                    <l>Enlightened, and their languished hope revived.</l>
                    <l>The invention all admired, and each, how he</l>
                    <l>To be the inventer missed; so easy it seemed</l>
                    <l>Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought</l>
                    <l>Impossible: Yet, haply, of thy race</l>
                    <l>In future days, if malice should abound,</l>
                    <l>Some one intent on mischief, or inspired</l>
                    <l>With devilish machination, might devise</l>
                    <l>Like instrument to plague the sons of men</l>
                    <l>For sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent.</l>
                    <l>Forthwith from council to the work they flew;</l>
                    <l>None arguing stood; innumerable hands</l>
                    <l>Were ready; in a moment up they turned</l>
                    <l>Wide the celestial soil, and saw beneath</l>
                    <l>The originals of nature in their crude</l>
                    <l>Conception; sulphurous and nitrous foam</l>
                    <l>They found, they mingled, and, with subtle art,</l>
                    <l>Concocted and adusted they reduced</l>
                    <l>To blackest grain, and into store conveyed:</l>
                    <l>Part hidden veins digged up (nor hath this earth</l>
                    <l>Entrails unlike) of mineral and stone,</l>
                    <l>Whereof to found their engines and their balls</l>
                    <l>Of missive ruin; part incentive reed</l>
                    <l>Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.</l>
                    <l>So all ere day-spring, under conscious night,</l>
                    <l>Secret they finished, and in order set,</l>
                    <l>With silent circumspection, unespied.</l>
                    <l>Now when fair morn orient in Heaven appeared,</l>
                    <l>Up rose the victor-Angels, and to arms</l>
                    <l>The matin trumpet sung: In arms they stood</l>
                    <l>Of golden panoply, refulgent host,</l>
                    <l>Soon banded; others from the dawning hills</l>
                    <l>Look round, and scouts each coast light-armed scour,</l>
                    <l>Each quarter to descry the distant foe,</l>
                    <l>Where lodged, or whither fled, or if for fight,</l>
                    <l>In motion or in halt: Him soon they met</l>
                    <l>Under spread ensigns moving nigh, in slow</l>
                    <l>But firm battalion; back with speediest sail</l>
                    <l>Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,</l>
                    <l>Came flying, and in mid air aloud thus cried.</l>
                    <l>Arm, Warriours, arm for fight; the foe at hand,</l>
                    <l>Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit</l>
                    <l>This day; fear not his flight; so thick a cloud</l>
                    <l>He comes, and settled in his face I see</l>
                    <l>Sad resolution, and secure: Let each</l>
                    <l>His adamantine coat gird well, and each</l>
                    <l>Fit well his helm, gripe fast his orbed shield,</l>
                    <l>Borne even or high; for this day will pour down,</l>
                    <l>If I conjecture aught, no drizzling shower,</l>
                    <l>But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire.</l>
                    <l>So warned he them, aware themselves, and soon</l>
                    <l>In order, quit of all impediment;</l>
                    <l>Instant without disturb they took alarm,</l>
                    <l>And onward moved embattled: When behold!</l>
                    <l>Not distant far with heavy pace the foe</l>
                    <l>Approaching gross and huge, in hollow cube</l>
                    <l>Training his devilish enginery, impaled</l>
                    <l>On every side with shadowing squadrons deep,</l>
                    <l>To hide the fraud. At interview both stood</l>
                    <l>A while; but suddenly at head appeared</l>
                    <l>Satan, and thus was heard commanding loud.</l>
                    <l>Vanguard, to right and left the front unfold;</l>
                    <l>That all may see who hate us, how we seek</l>
                    <l>Peace and composure, and with open breast</l>
                    <l>Stand ready to receive them, if they like</l>
                    <l>Our overture; and turn not back perverse:</l>
                    <l>But that I doubt; however witness, Heaven!</l>
                    <l>Heaven, witness thou anon! while we discharge</l>
                    <l>Freely our part: ye, who appointed stand</l>
                    <l>Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch</l>
                    <l>What we propound, and loud that all may hear!</l>
                    <l>So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce</l>
                    <l>Had ended; when to right and left the front</l>
                    <l>Divided, and to either flank retired:</l>
                    <l>Which to our eyes discovered, new and strange,</l>
                    <l>A triple mounted row of pillars laid</l>
                    <l>On wheels (for like to pillars most they seemed,</l>
                    <l>Or hollowed bodies made of oak or fir,</l>
                    <l>With branches lopt, in wood or mountain felled,)</l>
                    <l>Brass, iron, stony mould, had not their mouths</l>
                    <l>With hideous orifice gaped on us wide,</l>
                    <l>Portending hollow truce: At each behind</l>
                    <l>A Seraph stood, and in his hand a reed</l>
                    <l>Stood waving tipt with fire; while we, suspense,</l>
                    <l>Collected stood within our thoughts amused,</l>
                    <l>Not long; for sudden all at once their reeds</l>
                    <l>Put forth, and to a narrow vent applied</l>
                    <l>With nicest touch. Immediate in a flame,</l>
                    <l>But soon obscured with smoke, all Heaven appeared,</l>
                    <l>From those deep-throated engines belched, whose roar</l>
                    <l>Embowelled with outrageous noise the air,</l>
                    <l>And all her entrails tore, disgorging foul</l>
                    <l>Their devilish glut, chained thunderbolts and hail</l>
                    <l>Of iron globes; which, on the victor host</l>
                    <l>Levelled, with such impetuous fury smote,</l>
                    <l>That, whom they hit, none on their feet might stand,</l>
                    <l>Though standing else as rocks, but down they fell</l>
                    <l>By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rolled;</l>
                    <l>The sooner for their arms; unarmed, they might</l>
                    <l>Have easily, as Spirits, evaded swift</l>
                    <l>By quick contraction or remove; but now</l>
                    <l>Foul dissipation followed, and forced rout;</l>
                    <l>Nor served it to relax their serried files.</l>
                    <l>What should they do? if on they rushed, repulse</l>
                    <l>Repeated, and indecent overthrow</l>
                    <l>Doubled, would render them yet more despised,</l>
                    <l>And to their foes a laughter; for in view</l>
                    <l>Stood ranked of Seraphim another row,</l>
                    <l>In posture to displode their second tire</l>
                    <l>Of thunder: Back defeated to return</l>
                    <l>They worse abhorred. Satan beheld their plight,</l>
                    <l>And to his mates thus in derision called.</l>
                    <l>O Friends! why come not on these victors proud</l>
                    <l>Ere while they fierce were coming; and when we,</l>
                    <l>To entertain them fair with open front</l>
                    <l>And breast, (what could we more?) propounded terms</l>
                    <l>Of composition, straight they changed their minds,</l>
                    <l>Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,</l>
                    <l>As they would dance; yet for a dance they seemed</l>
                    <l>Somewhat extravagant and wild; perhaps</l>
                    <l>For joy of offered peace: But I suppose,</l>
                    <l>If our proposals once again were heard,</l>
                    <l>We should compel them to a quick result.</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Belial, in like gamesome mood.</l>
                    <l>Leader! the terms we sent were terms of weight,</l>
                    <l>Of hard contents, and full of force urged home;</l>
                    <l>Such as we might perceive amused them all,</l>
                    <l>And stumbled many: Who receives them right,</l>
                    <l>Had need from head to foot well understand;</l>
                    <l>Not understood, this gift they have besides,</l>
                    <l>They show us when our foes walk not upright.</l>
                    <l>So they among themselves in pleasant vein</l>
                    <l>Stood scoffing, hightened in their thoughts beyond</l>
                    <l>All doubt of victory: Eternal Might</l>
                    <l>To match with their inventions they presumed</l>
                    <l>So easy, and of his thunder made a scorn,</l>
                    <l>And all his host derided, while they stood</l>
                    <l>A while in trouble: But they stood not long;</l>
                    <l>Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms</l>
                    <l>Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.</l>
                    <l>Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power,</l>
                    <l>Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed!)</l>
                    <l>Their arms away they threw, and to the hills</l>
                    <l>(For Earth hath this variety from Heaven</l>
                    <l>Of pleasure situate in hill and dale,)</l>
                    <l>Light as the lightning glimpse they ran, they flew;</l>
                    <l>From their foundations loosening to and fro,</l>
                    <l>They plucked the seated hills, with all their load,</l>
                    <l>Rocks, waters, woods, and by the shaggy tops</l>
                    <l>Up-lifting bore them in their hands: Amaze,</l>
                    <l>Be sure, and terrour, seized the rebel host,</l>
                    <l>When coming towards them so dread they saw</l>
                    <l>The bottom of the mountains upward turned;</l>
                    <l>Till on those cursed engines’ triple-row</l>
                    <l>They saw them whelmed, and all their confidence</l>
                    <l>Under the weight of mountains buried deep;</l>
                    <l>Themselves invaded next, and on their heads</l>
                    <l>Main promontories flung, which in the air</l>
                    <l>Came shadowing, and oppressed whole legions armed;</l>
                    <l>Their armour helped their harm, crushed in and bruised</l>
                    <l>Into their substance pent, which wrought them pain</l>
                    <l>Implacable, and many a dolorous groan;</l>
                    <l>Long struggling underneath, ere they could wind</l>
                    <l>Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,</l>
                    <l>Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.</l>
                    <l>The rest, in imitation, to like arms</l>
                    <l>Betook them, and the neighbouring hills uptore:</l>
                    <l>So hills amid the air encountered hills,</l>
                    <l>Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire;</l>
                    <l>That under ground they fought in dismal shade;</l>
                    <l>Infernal noise! war seemed a civil game</l>
                    <l>To this uproar; horrid confusion heaped</l>
                    <l>Upon confusion rose: And now all Heaven</l>
                    <l>Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspread;</l>
                    <l>Had not the Almighty Father, where he sits</l>
                    <l>Shrined in his sanctuary of Heaven secure,</l>
                    <l>Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen</l>
                    <l>This tumult, and permitted all, advised:</l>
                    <l>That his great purpose he might so fulfil,</l>
                    <l>To honour his anointed Son avenged</l>
                    <l>Upon his enemies, and to declare</l>
                    <l>All power on him transferred: Whence to his Son,</l>
                    <l>The Assessour of his throne, he thus began.</l>
                    <l>Effulgence of my glory, Son beloved,</l>
                    <l>Son, in whose face invisible is beheld</l>
                    <l>Visibly, what by Deity I am;</l>
                    <l>And in whose hand what by decree I do,</l>
                    <l>Second Omnipotence! two days are past,</l>
                    <l>Two days, as we compute the days of Heaven,</l>
                    <l>Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame</l>
                    <l>These disobedient: Sore hath been their fight,</l>
                    <l>As likeliest was, when two such foes met armed;</l>
                    <l>For to themselves I left them; and thou knowest,</l>
                    <l>Equal in their creation they were formed,</l>
                    <l>Save what sin hath impaired; which yet hath wrought</l>
                    <l>Insensibly, for I suspend their doom;</l>
                    <l>Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last</l>
                    <l>Endless, and no solution will be found:</l>
                    <l>War wearied hath performed what war can do,</l>
                    <l>And to disordered rage let loose the reins</l>
                    <l>With mountains, as with weapons, armed; which makes</l>
                    <l>Wild work in Heaven, and dangerous to the main.</l>
                    <l>Two days are therefore past, the third is thine;</l>
                    <l>For thee I have ordained it; and thus far</l>
                    <l>Have suffered, that the glory may be thine</l>
                    <l>Of ending this great war, since none but Thou</l>
                    <l>Can end it. Into thee such virtue and grace</l>
                    <l>Immense I have transfused, that all may know</l>
                    <l>In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare;</l>
                    <l>And, this perverse commotion governed thus,</l>
                    <l>To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir</l>
                    <l>Of all things; to be Heir, and to be King</l>
                    <l>By sacred unction, thy deserved right.</l>
                    <l>Go then, Thou Mightiest, in thy Father’s might;</l>
                    <l>Ascend my chariot, guide the rapid wheels</l>
                    <l>That shake Heaven’s basis, bring forth all my war,</l>
                    <l>My bow and thunder, my almighty arms</l>
                    <l>Gird on, and sword upon thy puissant thigh;</l>
                    <l>Pursue these sons of darkness, drive them out</l>
                    <l>From all Heaven’s bounds into the utter deep:</l>
                    <l>There let them learn, as likes them, to despise</l>
                    <l>God, and Messiah his anointed King.</l>
                    <l>He said, and on his Son with rays direct</l>
                    <l>Shone full; he all his Father full expressed</l>
                    <l>Ineffably into his face received;</l>
                    <l>And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake.</l>
                    <l>O Father, O Supreme of heavenly Thrones,</l>
                    <l>First, Highest, Holiest, Best; thou always seek’st</l>
                    <l>To glorify thy Son, I always thee,</l>
                    <l>As is most just: This I my glory account,</l>
                    <l>My exaltation, and my whole delight,</l>
                    <l>That thou, in me well pleased, declarest thy will</l>
                    <l>Fulfilled, which to fulfil is all my bliss.</l>
                    <l>Scepter and power, thy giving, I assume,</l>
                    <l>And gladlier shall resign, when in the end</l>
                    <l>Thou shalt be all in all, and I in thee</l>
                    <l>For ever; and in me all whom thou lovest:</l>
                    <l>But whom thou hatest, I hate, and can put on</l>
                    <l>Thy terrours, as I put thy mildness on,</l>
                    <l>Image of thee in all things; and shall soon,</l>
                    <l>Armed with thy might, rid Heaven of these rebelled;</l>
                    <l>To their prepared ill mansion driven down,</l>
                    <l>To chains of darkness, and the undying worm;</l>
                    <l>That from thy just obedience could revolt,</l>
                    <l>Whom to obey is happiness entire.</l>
                    <l>Then shall thy Saints unmixed, and from the impure</l>
                    <l>Far separate, circling thy holy mount,</l>
                    <l>Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing,</l>
                    <l>Hymns of high praise, and I among them Chief.</l>
                    <l>So said, he, o’er his scepter bowing, rose</l>
                    <l>From the right hand of Glory where he sat;</l>
                    <l>And the third sacred morn began to shine,</l>
                    <l>Dawning through Heaven. Forth rushed with whirlwind sound</l>
                    <l>The chariot of Paternal Deity,</l>
                    <l>Flashing thick flames, wheel within wheel undrawn,</l>
                    <l>Itself instinct with Spirit, but convoyed</l>
                    <l>By four Cherubick shapes; four faces each</l>
                    <l>Had wonderous; as with stars, their bodies all</l>
                    <l>And wings were set with eyes; with eyes the wheels</l>
                    <l>Of beryl, and careering fires between;</l>
                    <l>Over their heads a crystal firmament,</l>
                    <l>Whereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure</l>
                    <l>Amber, and colours of the showery arch.</l>
                    <l>He, in celestial panoply all armed</l>
                    <l>Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought,</l>
                    <l>Ascended; at his right hand Victory</l>
                    <l>Sat eagle-winged; beside him hung his bow</l>
                    <l>And quiver with three-bolted thunder stored;</l>
                    <l>And from about him fierce effusion rolled</l>
                    <l>Of smoke, and bickering flame, and sparkles dire:</l>
                    <l>Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints,</l>
                    <l>He onward came; far off his coming shone;</l>
                    <l>And twenty thousand (I their number heard)</l>
                    <l>Chariots of God, half on each hand, were seen;</l>
                    <l>He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime</l>
                    <l>On the crystalline sky, in sapphire throned,</l>
                    <l>Illustrious far and wide; but by his own</l>
                    <l>First seen: Them unexpected joy surprised,</l>
                    <l>When the great ensign of Messiah blazed</l>
                    <l>Aloft by Angels borne, his sign in Heaven;</l>
                    <l>Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced</l>
                    <l>His army, circumfused on either wing,</l>
                    <l>Under their Head imbodied all in one.</l>
                    <l>Before him Power Divine his way prepared;</l>
                    <l>At his command the uprooted hills retired</l>
                    <l>Each to his place; they heard his voice, and went</l>
                    <l>Obsequious; Heaven his wonted face renewed,</l>
                    <l>And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled.</l>
                    <l>This saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured,</l>
                    <l>And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers,</l>
                    <l>Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.</l>
                    <l>In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?</l>
                    <l>But to convince the proud what signs avail,</l>
                    <l>Or wonders move the obdurate to relent?</l>
                    <l>They, hardened more by what might most reclaim,</l>
                    <l>Grieving to see his glory, at the sight</l>
                    <l>Took envy; and, aspiring to his highth,</l>
                    <l>Stood re-embattled fierce, by force or fraud</l>
                    <l>Weening to prosper, and at length prevail</l>
                    <l>Against God and Messiah, or to fall</l>
                    <l>In universal ruin last; and now</l>
                    <l>To final battle drew, disdaining flight,</l>
                    <l>Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God</l>
                    <l>To all his host on either hand thus spake.</l>
                    <l>Stand still in bright array, ye Saints; here stand,</l>
                    <l>Ye Angels armed; this day from battle rest:</l>
                    <l>Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God</l>
                    <l>Accepted, fearless in his righteous cause;</l>
                    <l>And as ye have received, so have ye done,</l>
                    <l>Invincibly: But of this cursed crew</l>
                    <l>The punishment to other hand belongs;</l>
                    <l>Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints:</l>
                    <l>Number to this day’s work is not ordained,</l>
                    <l>Nor multitude; stand only, and behold</l>
                    <l>God’s indignation on these godless poured</l>
                    <l>By me; not you, but me, they have despised,</l>
                    <l>Yet envied; against me is all their rage,</l>
                    <l>Because the Father, to whom in Heaven s’preme</l>
                    <l>Kingdom, and power, and glory appertains,</l>
                    <l>Hath honoured me, according to his will.</l>
                    <l>Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned;</l>
                    <l>That they may have their wish, to try with me</l>
                    <l>In battle which the stronger proves; they all,</l>
                    <l>Or I alone against them; since by strength</l>
                    <l>They measure all, of other excellence</l>
                    <l>Not emulous, nor care who them excels;</l>
                    <l>Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe.</l>
                    <l>So spake the Son, and into terrour changed</l>
                    <l>His countenance too severe to be beheld,</l>
                    <l>And full of wrath bent on his enemies.</l>
                    <l>At once the Four spread out their starry wings</l>
                    <l>With dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs</l>
                    <l>Of his fierce chariot rolled, as with the sound</l>
                    <l>Of torrent floods, or of a numerous host.</l>
                    <l>He on his impious foes right onward drove,</l>
                    <l>Gloomy as night; under his burning wheels</l>
                    <l>The stedfast empyrean shook throughout,</l>
                    <l>All but the throne itself of God. Full soon</l>
                    <l>Among them he arrived; in his right hand</l>
                    <l>Grasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent</l>
                    <l>Before him, such as in their souls infixed</l>
                    <l>Plagues: They, astonished, all resistance lost,</l>
                    <l>All courage; down their idle weapons dropt:</l>
                    <l>O’er shields, and helms, and helmed heads he rode</l>
                    <l>Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,</l>
                    <l>That wished the mountains now might be again</l>
                    <l>Thrown on them, as a shelter from his ire.</l>
                    <l>Nor less on either side tempestuous fell</l>
                    <l>His arrows, from the fourfold-visaged Four</l>
                    <l>Distinct with eyes, and from the living wheels</l>
                    <l>Distinct alike with multitude of eyes;</l>
                    <l>One Spirit in them ruled; and every eye</l>
                    <l>Glared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire</l>
                    <l>Among the accursed, that withered all their strength,</l>
                    <l>And of their wonted vigour left them drained,</l>
                    <l>Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen.</l>
                    <l>Yet half his strength he put not forth, but checked</l>
                    <l>His thunder in mid volley; for he meant</l>
                    <l>Not to destroy, but root them out of Heaven:</l>
                    <l>The overthrown he raised, and as a herd</l>
                    <l>Of goats or timorous flock together thronged</l>
                    <l>Drove them before him thunder-struck, pursued</l>
                    <l>With terrours, and with furies, to the bounds</l>
                    <l>And crystal wall of Heaven; which, opening wide,</l>
                    <l>Rolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed</l>
                    <l>Into the wasteful deep: The monstrous sight</l>
                    <l>Struck them with horrour backward, but far worse</l>
                    <l>Urged them behind: Headlong themselves they threw</l>
                    <l>Down from the verge of Heaven; eternal wrath</l>
                    <l>Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.</l>
                    <l>Hell heard the unsufferable noise, Hell saw</l>
                    <l>Heaven ruining from Heaven, and would have fled</l>
                    <l>Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep</l>
                    <l>Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.</l>
                    <l>Nine days they fell: Confounded Chaos roared,</l>
                    <l>And felt tenfold confusion in their fall</l>
                    <l>Through his wild anarchy, so huge a rout</l>
                    <l>Incumbered him with ruin: Hell at last</l>
                    <l>Yawning received them whole, and on them closed;</l>
                    <l>Hell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire</l>
                    <l>Unquenchable, the house of woe and pain.</l>
                    <l>Disburdened Heaven rejoiced, and soon repaired</l>
                    <l>Her mural breach, returning whence it rolled.</l>
                    <l>Sole victor, from the expulsion of his foes,</l>
                    <l>Messiah his triumphal chariot turned:</l>
                    <l>To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood</l>
                    <l>Eye-witnesses of his almighty acts,</l>
                    <l>With jubilee advanced; and, as they went,</l>
                    <l>Shaded with branching palm, each Order bright,</l>
                    <l>Sung triumph, and him sung victorious King,</l>
                    <l>Son, Heir, and Lord, to him dominion given,</l>
                    <l>Worthiest to reign: He, celebrated, rode</l>
                    <l>Triumphant through mid Heaven, into the courts</l>
                    <l>And temple of his Mighty Father throned</l>
                    <l>On high; who into glory him received,</l>
                    <l>Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.</l>
                    <l>Thus, measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth,</l>
                    <l>At thy request, and that thou mayest beware</l>
                    <l>By what is past, to thee I have revealed</l>
                    <l>What might have else to human race been hid;</l>
                    <l>The discord which befel, and war in Heaven</l>
                    <l>Among the angelick Powers, and the deep fall</l>
                    <l>Of those too high aspiring, who rebelled</l>
                    <l>With Satan; he who envies now thy state,</l>
                    <l>Who now is plotting how he may seduce</l>
                    <l>Thee also from obedience, that, with him</l>
                    <l>Bereaved of happiness, thou mayest partake</l>
                    <l>His punishment, eternal misery;</l>
                    <l>Which would be all his solace and revenge,</l>
                    <l>As a despite done against the Most High,</l>
                    <l>Thee once to gain companion of his woe.</l>
                    <l>But listen not to his temptations, warn</l>
                    <l>Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard,</l>
                    <l>By terrible example, the reward</l>
                    <l>Of disobedience; firm they might have stood,</l>
                    <l>Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.</l>

                    <l>Descend from Heaven, Urania, by that name</l>
                    <l>If rightly thou art called, whose voice divine</l>
                    <l>Following, above the Olympian hill I soar,</l>
                    <l>Above the flight of Pegasean wing!</l>
                    <l>The meaning, not the name, I call: for thou</l>
                    <l>Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top</l>
                    <l>Of old Olympus dwellest; but, heavenly-born,</l>
                    <l>Before the hills appeared, or fountain flowed,</l>
                    <l>Thou with eternal Wisdom didst converse,</l>
                    <l>Wisdom thy sister, and with her didst play</l>
                    <l>In presence of the Almighty Father, pleased</l>
                    <l>With thy celestial song. Up led by thee</l>
                    <l>Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed,</l>
                    <l>An earthly guest, and drawn empyreal air,</l>
                    <l>Thy tempering: with like safety guided down</l>
                    <l>Return me to my native element:</l>
                    <l>Lest from this flying steed unreined, (as once</l>
                    <l>Bellerophon, though from a lower clime,)</l>
                    <l>Dismounted, on the Aleian field I fall,</l>
                    <l>Erroneous there to wander, and forlorn.</l>
                    <l>Half yet remains unsung, but narrower bound</l>
                    <l>Within the visible diurnal sphere;</l>
                    <l>Standing on earth, not rapt above the pole,</l>
                    <l>More safe I sing with mortal voice, unchanged</l>
                    <l>To hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days,</l>
                    <l>On evil days though fallen, and evil tongues;</l>
                    <l>In darkness, and with dangers compassed round,</l>
                    <l>And solitude; yet not alone, while thou</l>
                    <l>Visitest my slumbers nightly, or when morn</l>
                    <l>Purples the east: still govern thou my song,</l>
                    <l>Urania, and fit audience find, though few.</l>
                    <l>But drive far off the barbarous dissonance</l>
                    <l>Of Bacchus and his revellers, the race</l>
                    <l>Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard</l>
                    <l>In Rhodope, where woods and rocks had ears</l>
                    <l>To rapture, till the savage clamour drowned</l>
                    <l>Both harp and voice; nor could the Muse defend</l>
                    <l>Her son. So fail not thou, who thee implores:</l>
                    <l>For thou art heavenly, she an empty dream.</l>
                    <l>Say, Goddess, what ensued when Raphael,</l>
                    <l>The affable Arch-Angel, had forewarned</l>
                    <l>Adam, by dire example, to beware</l>
                    <l>Apostasy, by what befel in Heaven</l>
                    <l>To those apostates; lest the like befall</l>
                    <l>In Paradise to Adam or his race,</l>
                    <l>Charged not to touch the interdicted tree,</l>
                    <l>If they transgress, and slight that sole command,</l>
                    <l>So easily obeyed amid the choice</l>
                    <l>Of all tastes else to please their appetite,</l>
                    <l>Though wandering. He, with his consorted Eve,</l>
                    <l>The story heard attentive, and was filled</l>
                    <l>With admiration and deep muse, to hear</l>
                    <l>Of things so high and strange; things, to their thought</l>
                    <l>So unimaginable, as hate in Heaven,</l>
                    <l>And war so near the peace of God in bliss,</l>
                    <l>With such confusion: but the evil, soon</l>
                    <l>Driven back, redounded as a flood on those</l>
                    <l>From whom it sprung; impossible to mix</l>
                    <l>With blessedness. Whence Adam soon repealed</l>
                    <l>The doubts that in his heart arose: and now</l>
                    <l>Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know</l>
                    <l>What nearer might concern him, how this world</l>
                    <l>Of Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began;</l>
                    <l>When, and whereof created; for what cause;</l>
                    <l>What within Eden, or without, was done</l>
                    <l>Before his memory; as one whose drouth</l>
                    <l>Yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream,</l>
                    <l>Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,</l>
                    <l>Proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest.</l>
                    <l>Great things, and full of wonder in our ears,</l>
                    <l>Far differing from this world, thou hast revealed,</l>
                    <l>Divine interpreter! by favour sent</l>
                    <l>Down from the empyrean, to forewarn</l>
                    <l>Us timely of what might else have been our loss,</l>
                    <l>Unknown, which human knowledge could not reach;</l>
                    <l>For which to the infinitely Good we owe</l>
                    <l>Immortal thanks, and his admonishment</l>
                    <l>Receive, with solemn purpose to observe</l>
                    <l>Immutably his sovran will, the end</l>
                    <l>Of what we are. But since thou hast vouchsafed</l>
                    <l>Gently, for our instruction, to impart</l>
                    <l>Things above earthly thought, which yet concerned</l>
                    <l>Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemed,</l>
                    <l>Deign to descend now lower, and relate</l>
                    <l>What may no less perhaps avail us known,</l>
                    <l>How first began this Heaven which we behold</l>
                    <l>Distant so high, with moving fires adorned</l>
                    <l>Innumerable; and this which yields or fills</l>
                    <l>All space, the ambient air wide interfused</l>
                    <l>Embracing round this floried Earth; what cause</l>
                    <l>Moved the Creator, in his holy rest</l>
                    <l>Through all eternity, so late to build</l>
                    <l>In Chaos; and the work begun, how soon</l>
                    <l>Absolved; if unforbid thou mayest unfold</l>
                    <l>What we, not to explore the secrets ask</l>
                    <l>Of his eternal empire, but the more</l>
                    <l>To magnify his works, the more we know.</l>
                    <l>And the great light of day yet wants to run</l>
                    <l>Much of his race though steep; suspense in Heaven,</l>
                    <l>Held by thy voice, thy potent voice, he hears,</l>
                    <l>And longer will delay to hear thee tell</l>
                    <l>His generation, and the rising birth</l>
                    <l>Of Nature from the unapparent Deep:</l>
                    <l>Or if the star of evening and the moon</l>
                    <l>Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring,</l>
                    <l>Silence; and Sleep, listening to thee, will watch;</l>
                    <l>Or we can bid his absence, till thy song</l>
                    <l>End, and dismiss thee ere the morning shine.</l>
                    <l>Thus Adam his illustrious guest besought:</l>
                    <l>And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild.</l>
                    <l>This also thy request, with caution asked,</l>
                    <l>Obtain; though to recount almighty works</l>
                    <l>What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,</l>
                    <l>Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?</l>
                    <l>Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve</l>
                    <l>To glorify the Maker, and infer</l>
                    <l>Thee also happier, shall not be withheld</l>
                    <l>Thy hearing; such commission from above</l>
                    <l>I have received, to answer thy desire</l>
                    <l>Of knowledge within bounds; beyond, abstain</l>
                    <l>To ask; nor let thine own inventions hope</l>
                    <l>Things not revealed, which the invisible King,</l>
                    <l>Only Omniscient, hath suppressed in night;</l>
                    <l>To none communicable in Earth or Heaven:</l>
                    <l>Enough is left besides to search and know.</l>
                    <l>But knowledge is as food, and needs no less</l>
                    <l>Her temperance over appetite, to know</l>
                    <l>In measure what the mind may well contain;</l>
                    <l>Oppresses else with surfeit, and soon turns</l>
                    <l>Wisdom to folly, as nourishment to wind.</l>
                    <l>Know then, that, after Lucifer from Heaven</l>
                    <l>(So call him, brighter once amidst the host</l>
                    <l>Of Angels, than that star the stars among,)</l>
                    <l>Fell with his flaming legions through the deep</l>
                    <l>Into his place, and the great Son returned</l>
                    <l>Victorious with his Saints, the Omnipotent</l>
                    <l>Eternal Father from his throne beheld</l>
                    <l>Their multitude, and to his Son thus spake.</l>
                    <l>At least our envious Foe hath failed, who thought</l>
                    <l>All like himself rebellious, by whose aid</l>
                    <l>This inaccessible high strength, the seat</l>
                    <l>Of Deity supreme, us dispossessed,</l>
                    <l>He trusted to have seised, and into fraud</l>
                    <l>Drew many, whom their place knows here no more:</l>
                    <l>Yet far the greater part have kept, I see,</l>
                    <l>Their station; Heaven, yet populous, retains</l>
                    <l>Number sufficient to possess her realms</l>
                    <l>Though wide, and this high temple to frequent</l>
                    <l>With ministeries due, and solemn rites:</l>
                    <l>But, lest his heart exalt him in the harm</l>
                    <l>Already done, to have dispeopled Heaven,</l>
                    <l>My damage fondly deemed, I can repair</l>
                    <l>That detriment, if such it be to lose</l>
                    <l>Self-lost; and in a moment will create</l>
                    <l>Another world, out of one man a race</l>
                    <l>Of men innumerable, there to dwell,</l>
                    <l>Not here; till, by degrees of merit raised,</l>
                    <l>They open to themselves at length the way</l>
                    <l>Up hither, under long obedience tried;</l>
                    <l>And Earth be changed to Heaven, and Heaven to Earth,</l>
                    <l>One kingdom, joy and union without end.</l>
                    <l>Mean while inhabit lax, ye Powers of Heaven;</l>
                    <l>And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee</l>
                    <l>This I perform; speak thou, and be it done!</l>
                    <l>My overshadowing Spirit and Might with thee</l>
                    <l>I send along; ride forth, and bid the Deep</l>
                    <l>Within appointed bounds be Heaven and Earth;</l>
                    <l>Boundless the Deep, because I Am who fill</l>
                    <l>Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.</l>
                    <l>Though I, uncircumscribed myself, retire,</l>
                    <l>And put not forth my goodness, which is free</l>
                    <l>To act or not, Necessity and Chance</l>
                    <l>Approach not me, and what I will is Fate.</l>
                    <l>So spake the Almighty, and to what he spake</l>
                    <l>His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect.</l>
                    <l>Immediate are the acts of God, more swift</l>
                    <l>Than time or motion, but to human ears</l>
                    <l>Cannot without process of speech be told,</l>
                    <l>So told as earthly notion can receive.</l>
                    <l>Great triumph and rejoicing was in Heaven,</l>
                    <l>When such was heard declared the Almighty’s will;</l>
                    <l>Glory they sung to the Most High, good will</l>
                    <l>To future men, and in their dwellings peace;</l>
                    <l>Glory to Him, whose just avenging ire</l>
                    <l>Had driven out the ungodly from his sight</l>
                    <l>And the habitations of the just; to Him</l>
                    <l>Glory and praise, whose wisdom had ordained</l>
                    <l>Good out of evil to create; instead</l>
                    <l>Of Spirits malign, a better race to bring</l>
                    <l>Into their vacant room, and thence diffuse</l>
                    <l>His good to worlds and ages infinite.</l>
                    <l>So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son</l>
                    <l>On his great expedition now appeared,</l>
                    <l>Girt with Omnipotence, with radiance crowned</l>
                    <l>Of Majesty Divine; sapience and love</l>
                    <l>Immense, and all his Father in him shone.</l>
                    <l>About his chariot numberless were poured</l>
                    <l>Cherub, and Seraph, Potentates, and Thrones,</l>
                    <l>And Virtues, winged Spirits, and chariots winged</l>
                    <l>From the armoury of God; where stand of old</l>
                    <l>Myriads, between two brazen mountains lodged</l>
                    <l>Against a solemn day, harnessed at hand,</l>
                    <l>Celestial equipage; and now came forth</l>
                    <l>Spontaneous, for within them Spirit lived,</l>
                    <l>Attendant on their Lord: Heaven opened wide</l>
                    <l>Her ever-during gates, harmonious sound</l>
                    <l>On golden hinges moving, to let forth</l>
                    <l>The King of Glory, in his powerful Word</l>
                    <l>And Spirit, coming to create new worlds.</l>
                    <l>On heavenly ground they stood; and from the shore</l>
                    <l>They viewed the vast immeasurable abyss</l>
                    <l>Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild,</l>
                    <l>Up from the bottom turned by furious winds</l>
                    <l>And surging waves, as mountains, to assault</l>
                    <l>Heaven’s highth, and with the center mix the pole.</l>
                    <l>Silence, ye troubled Waves, and thou Deep, peace,</l>
                    <l>Said then the Omnifick Word; your discord end!</l>
                    <l>Nor staid; but, on the wings of Cherubim</l>
                    <l>Uplifted, in paternal glory rode</l>
                    <l>Far into Chaos, and the world unborn;</l>
                    <l>For Chaos heard his voice: Him all his train</l>
                    <l>Followed in bright procession, to behold</l>
                    <l>Creation, and the wonders of his might.</l>
                    <l>Then staid the fervid wheels, and in his hand</l>
                    <l>He took the golden compasses, prepared</l>
                    <l>In God’s eternal store, to circumscribe</l>
                    <l>This universe, and all created things:</l>
                    <l>One foot he centered, and the other turned</l>
                    <l>Round through the vast profundity obscure;</l>
                    <l>And said, Thus far extend, thus far thy bounds,</l>
                    <l>This be thy just circumference, O World!</l>
                    <l>Thus God the Heaven created, thus the Earth,</l>
                    <l>Matter unformed and void: Darkness profound</l>
                    <l>Covered the abyss: but on the watery calm</l>
                    <l>His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread,</l>
                    <l>And vital virtue infused, and vital warmth</l>
                    <l>Throughout the fluid mass; but downward purged</l>
                    <l>The black tartareous cold infernal dregs,</l>
                    <l>Adverse to life: then founded, then conglobed</l>
                    <l>Like things to like; the rest to several place</l>
                    <l>Disparted, and between spun out the air;</l>
                    <l>And Earth self-balanced on her center hung.</l>
                    <l>Let there be light, said God; and forthwith Light</l>
                    <l>Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure,</l>
                    <l>Sprung from the deep; and from her native east</l>
                    <l>To journey through the aery gloom began,</l>
                    <l>Sphered in a radiant cloud, for yet the sun</l>
                    <l>Was not; she in a cloudy tabernacle</l>
                    <l>Sojourned the while. God saw the light was good;</l>
                    <l>And light from darkness by the hemisphere</l>
                    <l>Divided: light the Day, and darkness Night,</l>
                    <l>He named. Thus was the first day even and morn:</l>
                    <l>Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung</l>
                    <l>By the celestial quires, when orient light</l>
                    <l>Exhaling first from darkness they beheld;</l>
                    <l>Birth-day of Heaven and Earth; with joy and shout</l>
                    <l>The hollow universal orb they filled,</l>
                    <l>And touched their golden harps, and hymning praised</l>
                    <l>God and his works; Creator him they sung,</l>
                    <l>Both when first evening was, and when first morn.</l>
                    <l>Again, God said, Let there be firmament</l>
                    <l>Amid the waters, and let it divide</l>
                    <l>The waters from the waters; and God made</l>
                    <l>The firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,</l>
                    <l>Transparent, elemental air, diffused</l>
                    <l>In circuit to the uttermost convex</l>
                    <l>Of this great round; partition firm and sure,</l>
                    <l>The waters underneath from those above</l>
                    <l>Dividing: for as earth, so he the world</l>
                    <l>Built on circumfluous waters calm, in wide</l>
                    <l>Crystalline ocean, and the loud misrule</l>
                    <l>Of Chaos far removed; lest fierce extremes</l>
                    <l>Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:</l>
                    <l>And Heaven he named the Firmament: So even</l>
                    <l>And morning chorus sung the second day.</l>
                    <l>The Earth was formed, but in the womb as yet</l>
                    <l>Of waters, embryon immature involved,</l>
                    <l>Appeared not: over all the face of Earth</l>
                    <l>Main ocean flowed, not idle; but, with warm</l>
                    <l>Prolifick humour softening all her globe,</l>
                    <l>Fermented the great mother to conceive,</l>
                    <l>Satiate with genial moisture; when God said,</l>
                    <l>Be gathered now ye waters under Heaven</l>
                    <l>Into one place, and let dry land appear.</l>
                    <l>Immediately the mountains huge appear</l>
                    <l>Emergent, and their broad bare backs upheave</l>
                    <l>Into the clouds; their tops ascend the sky:</l>
                    <l>So high as heaved the tumid hills, so low</l>
                    <l>Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,</l>
                    <l>Capacious bed of waters: Thither they</l>
                    <l>Hasted with glad precipitance, uprolled,</l>
                    <l>As drops on dust conglobing from the dry:</l>
                    <l>Part rise in crystal wall, or ridge direct,</l>
                    <l>For haste; such flight the great command impressed</l>
                    <l>On the swift floods: As armies at the call</l>
                    <l>Of trumpet (for of armies thou hast heard)</l>
                    <l>Troop to their standard; so the watery throng,</l>
                    <l>Wave rolling after wave, where way they found,</l>
                    <l>If steep, with torrent rapture, if through plain,</l>
                    <l>Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them rock or hill;</l>
                    <l>But they, or under ground, or circuit wide</l>
                    <l>With serpent errour wandering, found their way,</l>
                    <l>And on the washy oose deep channels wore;</l>
                    <l>Easy, ere God had bid the ground be dry,</l>
                    <l>All but within those banks, where rivers now</l>
                    <l>Stream, and perpetual draw their humid train.</l>
                    <l>The dry land, Earth; and the great receptacle</l>
                    <l>Of congregated waters, he called Seas:</l>
                    <l>And saw that it was good; and said, Let the Earth</l>
                    <l>Put forth the verdant grass, herb yielding seed,</l>
                    <l>And fruit-tree yielding fruit after her kind,</l>
                    <l>Whose seed is in herself upon the Earth.</l>
                    <l>He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then</l>
                    <l>Desart and bare, unsightly, unadorned,</l>
                    <l>Brought forth the tender grass, whose verdure clad</l>
                    <l>Her universal face with pleasant green;</l>
                    <l>Then herbs of every leaf, that sudden flowered</l>
                    <l>Opening their various colours, and made gay</l>
                    <l>Her bosom, smelling sweet: and, these scarce blown,</l>
                    <l>Forth flourished thick the clustering vine, forth crept</l>
                    <l>The swelling gourd, up stood the corny reed</l>
                    <l>Embattled in her field, and the humble shrub,</l>
                    <l>And bush with frizzled hair implicit: Last</l>
                    <l>Rose, as in dance, the stately trees, and spread</l>
                    <l>Their branches hung with copious fruit, or gemmed</l>
                    <l>Their blossoms: With high woods the hills were crowned;</l>
                    <l>With tufts the valleys, and each fountain side;</l>
                    <l>With borders long the rivers: that Earth now</l>
                    <l>Seemed like to Heaven, a seat where Gods might dwell,</l>
                    <l>Or wander with delight, and love to haunt</l>
                    <l>Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rained</l>
                    <l>Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground</l>
                    <l>None was; but from the Earth a dewy mist</l>
                    <l>Went up, and watered all the ground, and each</l>
                    <l>Plant of the field; which, ere it was in the Earth,</l>
                    <l>God made, and every herb, before it grew</l>
                    <l>On the green stem: God saw that it was good:</l>
                    <l>So even and morn recorded the third day.</l>
                    <l>Again the Almighty spake, Let there be lights</l>
                    <l>High in the expanse of Heaven, to divide</l>
                    <l>The day from night; and let them be for signs,</l>
                    <l>For seasons, and for days, and circling years;</l>
                    <l>And let them be for lights, as I ordain</l>
                    <l>Their office in the firmament of Heaven,</l>
                    <l>To give light on the Earth; and it was so.</l>
                    <l>And God made two great lights, great for their use</l>
                    <l>To Man, the greater to have rule by day,</l>
                    <l>The less by night, altern; and made the stars,</l>
                    <l>And set them in the firmament of Heaven</l>
                    <l>To illuminate the Earth, and rule the day</l>
                    <l>In their vicissitude, and rule the night,</l>
                    <l>And light from darkness to divide. God saw,</l>
                    <l>Surveying his great work, that it was good:</l>
                    <l>For of celestial bodies first the sun</l>
                    <l>A mighty sphere he framed, unlightsome first,</l>
                    <l>Though of ethereal mould: then formed the moon</l>
                    <l>Globose, and every magnitude of stars,</l>
                    <l>And sowed with stars the Heaven, thick as a field:</l>
                    <l>Of light by far the greater part he took,</l>
                    <l>Transplanted from her cloudy shrine, and placed</l>
                    <l>In the sun’s orb, made porous to receive</l>
                    <l>And drink the liquid light; firm to retain</l>
                    <l>Her gathered beams, great palace now of light.</l>
                    <l>Hither, as to their fountain, other stars</l>
                    <l>Repairing, in their golden urns draw light,</l>
                    <l>And hence the morning-planet gilds her horns;</l>
                    <l>By tincture or reflection they augment</l>
                    <l>Their small peculiar, though from human sight</l>
                    <l>So far remote, with diminution seen,</l>
                    <l>First in his east the glorious lamp was seen,</l>
                    <l>Regent of day, and all the horizon round</l>
                    <l>Invested with bright rays, jocund to run</l>
                    <l>His longitude through Heaven’s high road; the gray</l>
                    <l>Dawn, and the Pleiades, before him danced,</l>
                    <l>Shedding sweet influence: Less bright the moon,</l>
                    <l>But opposite in levelled west was set,</l>
                    <l>His mirrour, with full face borrowing her light</l>
                    <l>From him; for other light she needed none</l>
                    <l>In that aspect, and still that distance keeps</l>
                    <l>Till night; then in the east her turn she shines,</l>
                    <l>Revolved on Heaven’s great axle, and her reign</l>
                    <l>With thousand lesser lights dividual holds,</l>
                    <l>With thousand thousand stars, that then appeared</l>
                    <l>Spangling the hemisphere: Then first adorned</l>
                    <l>With their bright luminaries that set and rose,</l>
                    <l>Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day.</l>
                    <l>And God said, Let the waters generate</l>
                    <l>Reptile with spawn abundant, living soul:</l>
                    <l>And let fowl fly above the Earth, with wings</l>
                    <l>Displayed on the open firmament of Heaven.</l>
                    <l>And God created the great whales, and each</l>
                    <l>Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously</l>
                    <l>The waters generated by their kinds;</l>
                    <l>And every bird of wing after his kind;</l>
                    <l>And saw that it was good, and blessed them, saying.</l>
                    <l>Be fruitful, multiply, and in the seas,</l>
                    <l>And lakes, and running streams, the waters fill;</l>
                    <l>And let the fowl be multiplied, on the Earth.</l>
                    <l>Forthwith the sounds and seas, each creek and bay,</l>
                    <l>With fry innumerable swarm, and shoals</l>
                    <l>Of fish that with their fins, and shining scales,</l>
                    <l>Glide under the green wave, in sculls that oft</l>
                    <l>Bank the mid sea: part single, or with mate,</l>
                    <l>Graze the sea-weed their pasture, and through groves</l>
                    <l>Of coral stray; or, sporting with quick glance,</l>
                    <l>Show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold;</l>
                    <l>Or, in their pearly shells at ease, attend</l>
                    <l>Moist nutriment; or under rocks their food</l>
                    <l>In jointed armour watch: on smooth the seal</l>
                    <l>And bended dolphins play: part huge of bulk</l>
                    <l>Wallowing unwieldy, enormous in their gait,</l>
                    <l>Tempest the ocean: there leviathan,</l>
                    <l>Hugest of living creatures, on the deep</l>
                    <l>Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims,</l>
                    <l>And seems a moving land; and at his gills</l>
                    <l>Draws in, and at his trunk spouts out, a sea.</l>
                    <l>Mean while the tepid caves, and fens, and shores,</l>
                    <l>Their brood as numerous hatch, from the egg that soon</l>
                    <l>Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed</l>
                    <l>Their callow young; but feathered soon and fledge</l>
                    <l>They summed their pens; and, soaring the air sublime,</l>
                    <l>With clang despised the ground, under a cloud</l>
                    <l>In prospect; there the eagle and the stork</l>
                    <l>On cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build:</l>
                    <l>Part loosely wing the region, part more wise</l>
                    <l>In common, ranged in figure, wedge their way,</l>
                    <l>Intelligent of seasons, and set forth</l>
                    <l>Their aery caravan, high over seas</l>
                    <l>Flying, and over lands, with mutual wing</l>
                    <l>Easing their flight; so steers the prudent crane</l>
                    <l>Her annual voyage, borne on winds; the air</l>
                    <l>Floats as they pass, fanned with unnumbered plumes:</l>
                    <l>From branch to branch the smaller birds with song</l>
                    <l>Solaced the woods, and spread their painted wings</l>
                    <l>Till even; nor then the solemn nightingale</l>
                    <l>Ceased warbling, but all night tun’d her soft lays:</l>
                    <l>Others, on silver lakes and rivers, bathed</l>
                    <l>Their downy breast; the swan with arched neck,</l>
                    <l>Between her white wings mantling proudly, rows</l>
                    <l>Her state with oary feet; yet oft they quit</l>
                    <l>The dank, and, rising on stiff pennons, tower</l>
                    <l>The mid aereal sky: Others on ground</l>
                    <l>Walked firm; the crested cock whose clarion sounds</l>
                    <l>The silent hours, and the other whose gay train</l>
                    <l>Adorns him, coloured with the florid hue</l>
                    <l>Of rainbows and starry eyes. The waters thus</l>
                    <l>With fish replenished, and the air with fowl,</l>
                    <l>Evening and morn solemnized the fifth day.</l>
                    <l>The sixth, and of creation last, arose</l>
                    <l>With evening harps and matin; when God said,</l>
                    <l>Let the Earth bring forth soul living in her kind,</l>
                    <l>Cattle, and creeping things, and beast of the Earth,</l>
                    <l>Each in their kind. The Earth obeyed, and straight</l>
                    <l>Opening her fertile womb teemed at a birth</l>
                    <l>Innumerous living creatures, perfect forms,</l>
                    <l>Limbed and full grown: Out of the ground up rose,</l>
                    <l>As from his lair, the wild beast where he wons</l>
                    <l>In forest wild, in thicket, brake, or den;</l>
                    <l>Among the trees in pairs they rose, they walked:</l>
                    <l>The cattle in the fields and meadows green:</l>
                    <l>Those rare and solitary, these in flocks</l>
                    <l>Pasturing at once, and in broad herds upsprung.</l>
                    <l>The grassy clods now calved; now half appeared</l>
                    <l>The tawny lion, pawing to get free</l>
                    <l>His hinder parts, then springs as broke from bonds,</l>
                    <l>And rampant shakes his brinded mane; the ounce,</l>
                    <l>The libbard, and the tiger, as the mole</l>
                    <l>Rising, the crumbled earth above them threw</l>
                    <l>In hillocks: The swift stag from under ground</l>
                    <l>Bore up his branching head: Scarce from his mould</l>
                    <l>Behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved</l>
                    <l>His vastness: Fleeced the flocks and bleating rose,</l>
                    <l>As plants: Ambiguous between sea and land</l>
                    <l>The river-horse, and scaly crocodile.</l>
                    <l>At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,</l>
                    <l>Insect or worm: those waved their limber fans</l>
                    <l>For wings, and smallest lineaments exact</l>
                    <l>In all the liveries decked of summer’s pride</l>
                    <l>With spots of gold and purple, azure and green:</l>
                    <l>These, as a line, their long dimension drew,</l>
                    <l>Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all</l>
                    <l>Minims of nature; some of serpent-kind,</l>
                    <l>Wonderous in length and corpulence, involved</l>
                    <l>Their snaky folds, and added wings. First crept</l>
                    <l>The parsimonious emmet, provident</l>
                    <l>Of future; in small room large heart enclosed;</l>
                    <l>Pattern of just equality perhaps</l>
                    <l>Hereafter, joined in her popular tribes</l>
                    <l>Of commonalty: Swarming next appeared</l>
                    <l>The female bee, that feeds her husband drone</l>
                    <l>Deliciously, and builds her waxen cells</l>
                    <l>With honey stored: The rest are numberless,</l>
                    <l>And thou their natures knowest, and gavest them names,</l>
                    <l>Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown</l>
                    <l>The serpent, subtlest beast of all the field,</l>
                    <l>Of huge extent sometimes, with brazen eyes</l>
                    <l>And hairy mane terrifick, though to thee</l>
                    <l>Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.</l>
                    <l>Now Heaven in all her glory shone, and rolled</l>
                    <l>Her motions, as the great first Mover’s hand</l>
                    <l>First wheeled their course: Earth in her rich attire</l>
                    <l>Consummate lovely smiled; air, water, earth,</l>
                    <l>By fowl, fish, beast, was flown, was swum, was walked,</l>
                    <l>Frequent; and of the sixth day yet remained:</l>
                    <l>There wanted yet the master-work, the end</l>
                    <l>Of all yet done; a creature, who, not prone</l>
                    <l>And brute as other creatures, but endued</l>
                    <l>With sanctity of reason, might erect</l>
                    <l>His stature, and upright with front serene</l>
                    <l>Govern the rest, self-knowing; and from thence</l>
                    <l>Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven,</l>
                    <l>But grateful to acknowledge whence his good</l>
                    <l>Descends, thither with heart, and voice, and eyes</l>
                    <l>Directed in devotion, to adore</l>
                    <l>And worship God Supreme, who made him chief</l>
                    <l>Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent</l>
                    <l>Eternal Father (for where is not he</l>
                    <l>Present?) thus to his Son audibly spake.</l>
                    <l>Let us make now Man in our image, Man</l>
                    <l>In our similitude, and let them rule</l>
                    <l>Over the fish and fowl of sea and air,</l>
                    <l>Beast of the field, and over all the Earth,</l>
                    <l>And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.</l>
                    <l>This said, he formed thee, Adam, thee, O Man,</l>
                    <l>Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breathed</l>
                    <l>The breath of life; in his own image he</l>
                    <l>Created thee, in the image of God</l>
                    <l>Express; and thou becamest a living soul.</l>
                    <l>Male he created thee; but thy consort</l>
                    <l>Female, for race; then blessed mankind, and said,</l>
                    <l>Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the Earth;</l>
                    <l>Subdue it, and throughout dominion hold</l>
                    <l>Over fish of the sea, and fowl of the air,</l>
                    <l>And every living thing that moves on the Earth.</l>
                    <l>Wherever thus created, for no place</l>
                    <l>Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou knowest,</l>
                    <l>He brought thee into this delicious grove,</l>
                    <l>This garden, planted with the trees of God,</l>
                    <l>Delectable both to behold and taste;</l>
                    <l>And freely all their pleasant fruit for food</l>
                    <l>Gave thee; all sorts are here that all the Earth yields,</l>
                    <l>Variety without end; but of the tree,</l>
                    <l>Which, tasted, works knowledge of good and evil,</l>
                    <l>Thou mayest not; in the day thou eatest, thou diest;</l>
                    <l>Death is the penalty imposed; beware,</l>
                    <l>And govern well thy appetite; lest Sin</l>
                    <l>Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.</l>
                    <l>Here finished he, and all that he had made</l>
                    <l>Viewed, and behold all was entirely good;</l>
                    <l>So even and morn accomplished the sixth day:</l>
                    <l>Yet not till the Creator from his work</l>
                    <l>Desisting, though unwearied, up returned,</l>
                    <l>Up to the Heaven of Heavens, his high abode;</l>
                    <l>Thence to behold this new created world,</l>
                    <l>The addition of his empire, how it showed</l>
                    <l>In prospect from his throne, how good, how fair,</l>
                    <l>Answering his great idea. Up he rode</l>
                    <l>Followed with acclamation, and the sound</l>
                    <l>Symphonious of ten thousand harps, that tuned</l>
                    <l>Angelick harmonies: The earth, the air</l>
                    <l>Resounded, (thou rememberest, for thou heardst,)</l>
                    <l>The heavens and all the constellations rung,</l>
                    <l>The planets in their station listening stood,</l>
                    <l>While the bright pomp ascended jubilant.</l>
                    <l>Open, ye everlasting gates! they sung,</l>
                    <l>Open, ye Heavens! your living doors; let in</l>
                    <l>The great Creator from his work returned</l>
                    <l>Magnificent, his six days work, a World;</l>
                    <l>Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deign</l>
                    <l>To visit oft the dwellings of just men,</l>
                    <l>Delighted; and with frequent intercourse</l>
                    <l>Thither will send his winged messengers</l>
                    <l>On errands of supernal grace. So sung</l>
                    <l>The glorious train ascending: He through Heaven,</l>
                    <l>That opened wide her blazing portals, led</l>
                    <l>To God’s eternal house direct the way;</l>
                    <l>A broad and ample road, whose dust is gold</l>
                    <l>And pavement stars, as stars to thee appear,</l>
                    <l>Seen in the galaxy, that milky way,</l>
                    <l>Which nightly, as a circling zone, thou seest</l>
                    <l>Powdered with stars. And now on Earth the seventh</l>
                    <l>Evening arose in Eden, for the sun</l>
                    <l>Was set, and twilight from the east came on,</l>
                    <l>Forerunning night; when at the holy mount</l>
                    <l>Of Heaven’s high-seated top, the imperial throne</l>
                    <l>Of Godhead, fixed for ever firm and sure,</l>
                    <l>The Filial Power arrived, and sat him down</l>
                    <l>With his great Father; for he also went</l>
                    <l>Invisible, yet staid, (such privilege</l>
                    <l>Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordained,</l>
                    <l>Author and End of all things; and, from work</l>
                    <l>Now resting, blessed and hallowed the seventh day,</l>
                    <l>As resting on that day from all his work,</l>
                    <l>But not in silence holy kept: the harp</l>
                    <l>Had work and rested not; the solemn pipe,</l>
                    <l>And dulcimer, all organs of sweet stop,</l>
                    <l>All sounds on fret by string or golden wire,</l>
                    <l>Tempered soft tunings, intermixed with voice</l>
                    <l>Choral or unison: of incense clouds,</l>
                    <l>Fuming from golden censers, hid the mount.</l>
                    <l>Creation and the six days acts they sung:</l>
                    <l>Great are thy works, Jehovah! infinite</l>
                    <l>Thy power! what thought can measure thee, or tongue</l>
                    <l>Relate thee! Greater now in thy return</l>
                    <l>Than from the giant Angels: Thee that day</l>
                    <l>Thy thunders magnified; but to create</l>
                    <l>Is greater than created to destroy.</l>
                    <l>Who can impair thee, Mighty King, or bound</l>
                    <l>Thy empire! Easily the proud attempt</l>
                    <l>Of Spirits apostate, and their counsels vain,</l>
                    <l>Thou hast repelled; while impiously they thought</l>
                    <l>Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw</l>
                    <l>The number of thy worshippers. Who seeks</l>
                    <l>To lessen thee, against his purpose serves</l>
                    <l>To manifest the more thy might: his evil</l>
                    <l>Thou usest, and from thence createst more good.</l>
                    <l>Witness this new-made world, another Heaven</l>
                    <l>From Heaven-gate not far, founded in view</l>
                    <l>On the clear hyaline, the glassy sea;</l>
                    <l>Of amplitude almost immense, with stars</l>
                    <l>Numerous, and every star perhaps a world</l>
                    <l>Of destined habitation; but thou knowest</l>
                    <l>Their seasons: among these the seat of Men,</l>
                    <l>Earth, with her nether ocean circumfused,</l>
                    <l>Their pleasant dwelling-place. Thrice happy Men,</l>
                    <l>And sons of Men, whom God hath thus advanced!</l>
                    <l>Created in his image, there to dwell</l>
                    <l>And worship him; and in reward to rule</l>
                    <l>Over his works, on earth, in sea, or air,</l>
                    <l>And multiply a race of worshippers</l>
                    <l>Holy and just: Thrice happy, if they know</l>
                    <l>Their happiness, and persevere upright!</l>
                    <l>So sung they, and the empyrean rung</l>
                    <l>With halleluiahs: Thus was sabbath kept.</l>
                    <l>And thy request think now fulfilled, that asked</l>
                    <l>How first this world and face of things began,</l>
                    <l>And what before thy memory was done</l>
                    <l>From the beginning; that posterity,</l>
                    <l>Informed by thee, might know: If else thou seekest</l>
                    <l>Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.</l>

                    <l>The Angel ended, and in Adam’s ear</l>
                    <l>So charming left his voice, that he a while</l>
                    <l>Thought him still speaking, still stood fixed to hear;</l>
                    <l>Then, as new waked, thus gratefully replied.</l>
                    <l>What thanks sufficient, or what recompence</l>
                    <l>Equal, have I to render thee, divine</l>
                    <l>Historian, who thus largely hast allayed</l>
                    <l>The thirst I had of knowledge, and vouchsafed</l>
                    <l>This friendly condescension to relate</l>
                    <l>Things, else by me unsearchable; now heard</l>

                    <l>When I behold this goodly frame, this world,</l>

                    <l>Their magnitudes; this Earth, a spot, a grain,</l>
                    <l>An atom, with the firmament compared</l>

                    <l>Spaces incomprehensible, (for such</l>
                    <l>Their distance argues, and their swift return</l>
                    <l>Diurnal,) merely to officiate light</l>
                    <l>Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,</l>
                    <l>One day and night; in all her vast survey</l>
                    <l>Useless besides; reasoning I oft admire,</l>
                    <l>How Nature wise and frugal could commit</l>
                    <l>Such disproportions, with superfluous hand</l>
                    <l>So many nobler bodies to create,</l>
                    <l>Greater so manifold, to this one use,</l>
                    <l>For aught appears, and on their orbs impose</l>
                    <l>Such restless revolution day by day</l>
                    <l>Repeated; while the sedentary Earth,</l>
                    <l>That better might with far less compass move,</l>
                    <l>Served by more noble than herself, attains</l>
                    <l>Her end without least motion, and receives,</l>
                    <l>As tribute, such a sumless journey brought</l>
                    <l>Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;</l>
                    <l>Speed, to describe whose swiftness number fails.</l>
                    <l>So spake our sire, and by his countenance seemed</l>
                    <l>Entering on studious thoughts abstruse; which Eve</l>
                    <l>Perceiving, where she sat retired in sight,</l>
                    <l>With lowliness majestick from her seat,</l>
                    <l>And grace that won who saw to wish her stay,</l>
                    <l>Rose, and went forth among her fruits and flowers,</l>
                    <l>To visit how they prospered, bud and bloom,</l>
                    <l>Her nursery; they at her coming sprung,</l>
                    <l>And, touched by her fair tendance, gladlier grew.</l>
                    <l>Yet went she not, as not with such discourse</l>
                    <l>Delighted, or not capable her ear</l>
                    <l>Of what was high: such pleasure she reserved,</l>
                    <l>Adam relating, she sole auditress;</l>
                    <l>Her husband the relater she preferred</l>
                    <l>Before the Angel, and of him to ask</l>
                    <l>Chose rather; he, she knew, would intermix</l>
                    <l>Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute</l>
                    <l>With conjugal caresses: from his lip</l>
                    <l>Not words alone pleased her. O! when meet now</l>
                    <l>Such pairs, in love and mutual honour joined?</l>
                    <l>With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went,</l>
                    <l>Not unattended; for on her, as Queen,</l>
                    <l>A pomp of winning Graces waited still,</l>
                    <l>And from about her shot darts of desire</l>
                    <l>Into all eyes, to wish her still in sight.</l>
                    <l>And Raphael now, to Adam’s doubt proposed,</l>
                    <l>Benevolent and facile thus replied.</l>
                    <l>To ask or search, I blame thee not; for Heaven</l>
                    <l>Is as the book of God before thee set,</l>
                    <l>Wherein to read his wonderous works, and learn</l>
                    <l>His seasons, hours, or days, or months, or years:</l>
                    <l>This to attain, whether Heaven move or Earth,</l>
                    <l>Imports not, if thou reckon right; the rest</l>
                    <l>From Man or Angel the great Architect</l>
                    <l>Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge</l>
                    <l>His secrets to be scanned by them who ought</l>
                    <l>Rather admire; or, if they list to try</l>
                    <l>Conjecture, he his fabrick of the Heavens</l>
                    <l>Hath left to their disputes, perhaps to move</l>
                    <l>His laughter at their quaint opinions wide</l>
                    <l>Hereafter; when they come to model Heaven</l>
                    <l>And calculate the stars, how they will wield</l>
                    <l>The mighty frame; how build, unbuild, contrive</l>
                    <l>To save appearances; how gird the sphere</l>
                    <l>With centrick and eccentrick scribbled o’er,</l>
                    <l>Cycle and epicycle, orb in orb:</l>
                    <l>Already by thy reasoning this I guess,</l>
                    <l>Who art to lead thy offspring, and supposest</l>
                    <l>That bodies bright and greater should not serve</l>
                    <l>The less not bright, nor Heaven such journeys run,</l>
                    <l>Earth sitting still, when she alone receives</l>
                    <l>The benefit: Consider first, that great</l>
                    <l>Or bright infers not excellence: the Earth</l>
                    <l>Though, in comparison of Heaven, so small,</l>
                    <l>Nor glistering, may of solid good contain</l>
                    <l>More plenty than the sun that barren shines;</l>
                    <l>Whose virtue on itself works no effect,</l>
                    <l>But in the fruitful Earth; there first received,</l>
                    <l>His beams, unactive else, their vigour find.</l>
                    <l>Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries</l>
                    <l>Officious; but to thee, Earth’s habitant.</l>
                    <l>And for the Heaven’s wide circuit, let it speak</l>
                    <l>The Maker’s high magnificence, who built</l>
                    <l>So spacious, and his line stretched out so far;</l>
                    <l>That Man may know he dwells not in his own;</l>
                    <l>An edifice too large for him to fill,</l>
                    <l>Lodged in a small partition; and the rest</l>
                    <l>Ordained for uses to his Lord best known.</l>
                    <l>The swiftness of those circles attribute,</l>
                    <l>Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,</l>
                    <l>That to corporeal substances could add</l>
                    <l>Speed almost spiritual: Me thou thinkest not slow,</l>
                    <l>Who since the morning-hour set out from Heaven</l>
                    <l>Where God resides, and ere mid-day arrived</l>
                    <l>In Eden; distance inexpressible</l>
                    <l>By numbers that have name. But this I urge,</l>
                    <l>Admitting motion in the Heavens, to show</l>
                    <l>Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved;</l>
                    <l>Not that I so affirm, though so it seem</l>
                    <l>To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.</l>
                    <l>God, to remove his ways from human sense,</l>
                    <l>Placed Heaven from Earth so far, that earthly sight,</l>
                    <l>If it presume, might err in things too high,</l>
                    <l>And no advantage gain. What if the sun</l>
                    <l>Be center to the world; and other stars,</l>
                    <l>By his attractive virtue and their own</l>
                    <l>Incited, dance about him various rounds?</l>
                    <l>Their wandering course now high, now low, then hid,</l>
                    <l>Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,</l>
                    <l>In six thou seest; and what if seventh to these</l>
                    <l>The planet earth, so stedfast though she seem,</l>
                    <l>Insensibly three different motions move?</l>
                    <l>Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe,</l>
                    <l>Moved contrary with thwart obliquities;</l>
                    <l>Or save the sun his labour, and that swift</l>
                    <l>Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed,</l>
                    <l>Invisible else above all stars, the wheel</l>
                    <l>Of day and night; which needs not thy belief,</l>
                    <l>If earth, industrious of herself, fetch day</l>
                    <l>Travelling east, and with her part averse</l>
                    <l>From the sun’s beam meet night, her other part</l>
                    <l>Still luminous by his ray. What if that light,</l>
                    <l>Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air,</l>
                    <l>To the terrestrial moon be as a star,</l>
                    <l>Enlightening her by day, as she by night</l>
                    <l>This earth? reciprocal, if land be there,</l>
                    <l>Fields and inhabitants: Her spots thou seest</l>
                    <l>As clouds, and clouds may rain, and rain produce</l>
                    <l>Fruits in her softened soil for some to eat</l>
                    <l>Allotted there; and other suns perhaps,</l>
                    <l>With their attendant moons, thou wilt descry,</l>
                    <l>Communicating male and female light;</l>
                    <l>Which two great sexes animate the world,</l>
                    <l>Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live.</l>
                    <l>For such vast room in Nature unpossessed</l>
                    <l>By living soul, desart and desolate,</l>
                    <l>Only to shine, yet scarce to contribute</l>
                    <l>Each orb a glimpse of light, conveyed so far</l>
                    <l>Down to this habitable, which returns</l>
                    <l>Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.</l>
                    <l>But whether thus these things, or whether not;</l>
                    <l>But whether the sun, predominant in Heaven,</l>
                    <l>Rise on the earth; or earth rise on the sun;</l>
                    <l>He from the east his flaming road begin;</l>
                    <l>Or she from west her silent course advance,</l>
                    <l>With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps</l>
                    <l>On her soft axle, while she paces even,</l>
                    <l>And bears thee soft with the smooth air along;</l>
                    <l>Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid;</l>
                    <l>Leave them to God above; him serve, and fear!</l>
                    <l>Of other creatures, as him pleases best,</l>
                    <l>Wherever placed, let him dispose; joy thou</l>
                    <l>In what he gives to thee, this Paradise</l>
                    <l>And thy fair Eve; Heaven is for thee too high</l>
                    <l>To know what passes there; be lowly wise:</l>
                    <l>Think only what concerns thee, and thy being;</l>
                    <l>Dream not of other worlds, what creatures there</l>
                    <l>Live, in what state, condition, or degree;</l>
                    <l>Contented that thus far hath been revealed</l>
                    <l>Not of Earth only, but of highest Heaven.</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Adam, cleared of doubt, replied.</l>
                    <l>How fully hast thou satisfied me, pure</l>
                    <l>Intelligence of Heaven, Angel serene!</l>
                    <l>And, freed from intricacies, taught to live</l>
                    <l>The easiest way; nor with perplexing thoughts</l>
                    <l>To interrupt the sweet of life, from which</l>
                    <l>God hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares,</l>
                    <l>And not molest us; unless we ourselves</l>
                    <l>Seek them with wandering thoughts, and notions vain.</l>
                    <l>But apt the mind or fancy is to rove</l>
                    <l>Unchecked, and of her roving is no end;</l>
                    <l>Till warned, or by experience taught, she learn,</l>
                    <l>That, not to know at large of things remote</l>
                    <l>From use, obscure and subtle; but, to know</l>
                    <l>That which before us lies in daily life,</l>
                    <l>Is the prime wisdom: What is more, is fume,</l>
                    <l>Or emptiness, or fond impertinence:</l>
                    <l>And renders us, in things that most concern,</l>
                    <l>Unpractised, unprepared, and still to seek.</l>
                    <l>Therefore from this high pitch let us descend</l>
                    <l>A lower flight, and speak of things at hand</l>
                    <l>Useful; whence, haply, mention may arise</l>
                    <l>Of something not unseasonable to ask,</l>
                    <l>By sufferance, and thy wonted favour, deigned.</l>
                    <l>Thee I have heard relating what was done</l>
                    <l>Ere my remembrance: now, hear me relate</l>
                    <l>My story, which perhaps thou hast not heard;</l>
                    <l>And day is not yet spent; till then thou seest</l>
                    <l>How subtly to detain thee I devise;</l>
                    <l>Inviting thee to hear while I relate;</l>
                    <l>Fond! were it not in hope of thy reply:</l>
                    <l>For, while I sit with thee, I seem in Heaven;</l>
                    <l>And sweeter thy discourse is to my ear</l>
                    <l>Than fruits of palm-tree pleasantest to thirst</l>
                    <l>And hunger both, from labour, at the hour</l>
                    <l>Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill,</l>
                    <l>Though pleasant; but thy words, with grace divine</l>
                    <l>Imbued, bring to their sweetness no satiety.</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek.</l>
                    <l>Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,</l>
                    <l>Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee</l>
                    <l>Abundantly his gifts hath also poured</l>
                    <l>Inward and outward both, his image fair:</l>
                    <l>Speaking, or mute, all comeliness and grace</l>
                    <l>Attends thee; and each word, each motion, forms;</l>
                    <l>Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth</l>
                    <l>Than of our fellow-servant, and inquire</l>
                    <l>Gladly into the ways of God with Man:</l>
                    <l>For God, we see, hath honoured thee, and set</l>
                    <l>On Man his equal love: Say therefore on;</l>
                    <l>For I that day was absent, as befel,</l>
                    <l>Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,</l>
                    <l>Far on excursion toward the gates of Hell;</l>
                    <l>Squared in full legion (such command we had)</l>
                    <l>To see that none thence issued forth a spy,</l>
                    <l>Or enemy, while God was in his work;</l>
                    <l>Lest he, incensed at such eruption bold,</l>
                    <l>Destruction with creation might have mixed.</l>
                    <l>Not that they durst without his leave attempt;</l>
                    <l>But us he sends upon his high behests</l>
                    <l>For state, as Sovran King; and to inure</l>
                    <l>Our prompt obedience. Fast we found, fast shut,</l>
                    <l>The dismal gates, and barricadoed strong;</l>
                    <l>But long ere our approaching heard within</l>
                    <l>Noise, other than the sound of dance or song,</l>
                    <l>Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage.</l>
                    <l>Glad we returned up to the coasts of light</l>
                    <l>Ere sabbath-evening: so we had in charge.</l>
                    <l>But thy relation now; for I attend,</l>
                    <l>Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine.</l>
                    <l>So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.</l>
                    <l>For Man to tell how human life began</l>
                    <l>Is hard; for who himself beginning knew</l>
                    <l>Desire with thee still longer to converse</l>
                    <l>Induced me. As new waked from soundest sleep,</l>
                    <l>Soft on the flowery herb I found me laid,</l>
                    <l>In balmy sweat; which with his beams the sun</l>
                    <l>Soon dried, and on the reeking moisture fed.</l>
                    <l>Straight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned,</l>
                    <l>And gazed a while the ample sky; till, raised</l>
                    <l>By quick instinctive motion, up I sprung,</l>
                    <l>As thitherward endeavouring, and upright</l>
                    <l>Stood on my feet: about me round I saw</l>
                    <l>Hill, dale, and shady woods, and sunny plains,</l>
                    <l>And liquid lapse of murmuring streams; by these,</l>
                    <l>Creatures that lived and moved, and walked, or flew;</l>
                    <l>Birds on the branches warbling; all things smiled;</l>
                    <l>With fragrance and with joy my heart o’erflowed.</l>
                    <l>Myself I then perused, and limb by limb</l>
                    <l>Surveyed, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran</l>
                    <l>With supple joints, as lively vigour led:</l>
                    <l>But who I was, or where, or from what cause,</l>
                    <l>Knew not; to speak I tried, and forthwith spake;</l>
                    <l>My tongue obeyed, and readily could name</l>
                    <l>Whate’er I saw. Thou Sun, said I, fair light,</l>
                    <l>And thou enlightened Earth, so fresh and gay,</l>
                    <l>Ye Hills, and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plains,</l>
                    <l>And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,</l>
                    <l>Tell, if ye saw, how I came thus, how here?—</l>
                    <l>Not of myself;—by some great Maker then,</l>
                    <l>In goodness and in power pre-eminent:</l>
                    <l>Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,</l>
                    <l>From whom I have that thus I move and live,</l>
                    <l>And feel that I am happier than I know.—</l>
                    <l>While thus I called, and strayed I knew not whither,</l>
                    <l>From where I first drew air, and first beheld</l>
                    <l>This happy light; when, answer none returned,</l>
                    <l>On a green shady bank, profuse of flowers,</l>
                    <l>Pensive I sat me down: There gentle sleep</l>
                    <l>First found me, and with soft oppression seised</l>
                    <l>My droused sense, untroubled, though I thought</l>
                    <l>I then was passing to my former state</l>
                    <l>Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve:</l>
                    <l>When suddenly stood at my head a dream,</l>
                    <l>Whose inward apparition gently moved</l>
                    <l>My fancy to believe I yet had being,</l>
                    <l>And lived: One came, methought, of shape divine,</l>
                    <l>And said, “Thy mansion wants thee, Adam; rise,</l>
                    <l>First Man, of men innumerable ordained</l>
                    <l>First Father! called by thee, I come thy guide</l>
                    <l>To the garden of bliss, thy seat prepared.”</l>
                    <l>So saying, by the hand he took me raised,</l>
                    <l>And over fields and waters, as in air</l>
                    <l>Smooth-sliding without step, last led me up</l>
                    <l>A woody mountain; whose high top was plain,</l>
                    <l>A circuit wide, enclosed, with goodliest trees</l>
                    <l>Planted, with walks, and bowers; that what I saw</l>
                    <l>Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemed. Each tree,</l>
                    <l>Loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye</l>
                    <l>Tempting, stirred in me sudden appetite</l>
                    <l>To pluck and eat; whereat I waked, and found</l>
                    <l>Before mine eyes all real, as the dream</l>
                    <l>Had lively shadowed: Here had new begun</l>
                    <l>My wandering, had not he, who was my guide</l>
                    <l>Up hither, from among the trees appeared,</l>
                    <l>Presence Divine. Rejoicing, but with awe,</l>
                    <l>In adoration at his feet I fell</l>
                    <l>Submiss: He reared me, and “Whom thou soughtest I am,”</l>
                    <l>Said mildly, “Author of all this thou seest</l>
                    <l>Above, or round about thee, or beneath.</l>
                    <l>This Paradise I give thee, count it thine</l>
                    <l>To till and keep, and of the fruit to eat:</l>
                    <l>Of every tree that in the garden grows</l>
                    <l>Eat freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth:</l>
                    <l>But of the tree whose operation brings</l>
                    <l>Knowledge of good and ill, which I have set</l>
                    <l>The pledge of thy obedience and thy faith,</l>
                    <l>Amid the garden by the tree of life,</l>
                    <l>Remember what I warn thee, shun to taste,</l>
                    <l>And shun the bitter consequence: for know,</l>
                    <l>The day thou eatest thereof, my sole command</l>
                    <l>Transgressed, inevitably thou shalt die,</l>
                    <l>From that day mortal; and this happy state</l>
                    <l>Shalt lose, expelled from hence into a world</l>
                    <l>Of woe and sorrow.” Sternly he pronounced</l>
                    <l>The rigid interdiction, which resounds</l>
                    <l>Yet dreadful in mine ear, though in my choice</l>
                    <l>Not to incur; but soon his clear aspect</l>
                    <l>Returned, and gracious purpose thus renewed.</l>
                    <l>“Not only these fair bounds, but all the Earth</l>
                    <l>To thee and to thy race I give; as lords</l>
                    <l>Possess it, and all things that therein live,</l>
                    <l>Or live in sea, or air; beast, fish, and fowl.</l>
                    <l>In sign whereof, each bird and beast behold</l>
                    <l>After their kinds; I bring them to receive</l>
                    <l>From thee their names, and pay thee fealty</l>
                    <l>With low subjection; understand the same</l>
                    <l>Of fish within their watery residence,</l>
                    <l>Not hither summoned, since they cannot change</l>
                    <l>Their element, to draw the thinner air.”</l>
                    <l>As thus he spake, each bird and beast behold</l>
                    <l>Approaching two and two; these cowering low</l>
                    <l>With blandishment; each bird stooped on his wing.</l>
                    <l>I named them, as they passed, and understood</l>
                    <l>Their nature, with such knowledge God endued</l>
                    <l>My sudden apprehension: But in these</l>
                    <l>I found not what methought I wanted still;</l>
                    <l>And to the heavenly Vision thus presumed.</l>
                    <l>O, by what name, for thou above all these,</l>
                    <l>Above mankind, or aught than mankind higher,</l>
                    <l>Surpassest far my naming; how may I</l>
                    <l>Adore thee, Author of this universe,</l>
                    <l>And all this good to man? for whose well being</l>
                    <l>So amply, and with hands so liberal,</l>
                    <l>Thou hast provided all things: But with me</l>
                    <l>I see not who partakes. In solitude</l>
                    <l>What happiness, who can enjoy alone,</l>
                    <l>Or, all enjoying, what contentment find?</l>
                    <l>Thus I presumptuous; and the Vision bright,</l>
                    <l>As with a smile more brightened, thus replied.</l>
                    <l>What callest thou solitude? Is not the Earth</l>
                    <l>With various living creatures, and the air</l>
                    <l>Replenished, and all these at thy command</l>
                    <l>To come and play before thee? Knowest thou not</l>
                    <l>Their language and their ways? They also know,</l>
                    <l>And reason not contemptibly: With these</l>
                    <l>Find pastime, and bear rule; thy realm is large.</l>
                    <l>So spake the Universal Lord, and seemed</l>
                    <l>So ordering: I, with leave of speech implored,</l>
                    <l>And humble deprecation, thus replied.</l>
                    <l>Let not my words offend thee, Heavenly Power;</l>
                    <l>My Maker, be propitious while I speak.</l>
                    <l>Hast thou not made me here thy substitute,</l>
                    <l>And these inferiour far beneath me set?</l>
                    <l>Among unequals what society</l>
                    <l>Can sort, what harmony, or true delight?</l>
                    <l>Which must be mutual, in proportion due</l>
                    <l>Given and received; but, in disparity</l>
                    <l>The one intense, the other still remiss,</l>
                    <l>Cannot well suit with either, but soon prove</l>
                    <l>Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak</l>
                    <l>Such as I seek, fit to participate</l>
                    <l>All rational delight: wherein the brute</l>
                    <l>Cannot be human consort: They rejoice</l>
                    <l>Each with their kind, lion with lioness;</l>
                    <l>So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined:</l>
                    <l>Much less can bird with beast, or fish with fowl</l>
                    <l>So well converse, nor with the ox the ape;</l>
                    <l>Worse then can man with beast, and least of all.</l>
                    <l>Whereto the Almighty answered, not displeased.</l>
                    <l>A nice and subtle happiness, I see,</l>
                    <l>Thou to thyself proposest, in the choice</l>
                    <l>Of thy associates, Adam! and wilt taste</l>
                    <l>No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitary.</l>
                    <l>What thinkest thou then of me, and this my state?</l>
                    <l>Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed</l>
                    <l>Of happiness, or not? who am alone</l>
                    <l>From all eternity; for none I know</l>
                    <l>Second to me or like, equal much less.</l>
                    <l>How have I then with whom to hold converse,</l>
                    <l>Save with the creatures which I made, and those</l>
                    <l>To me inferiour, infinite descents</l>
                    <l>Beneath what other creatures are to thee?</l>
                    <l>He ceased; I lowly answered. To attain</l>
                    <l>The highth and depth of thy eternal ways</l>
                    <l>All human thoughts come short, Supreme of things!</l>
                    <l>Thou in thyself art perfect, and in thee</l>
                    <l>Is no deficience found: Not so is Man,</l>
                    <l>But in degree; the cause of his desire</l>
                    <l>By conversation with his like to help</l>
                    <l>Or solace his defects. No need that thou</l>
                    <l>Shouldst propagate, already Infinite;</l>
                    <l>And through all numbers absolute, though One:</l>
                    <l>But Man by number is to manifest</l>
                    <l>His single imperfection, and beget</l>
                    <l>Like of his like, his image multiplied,</l>
                    <l>In unity defective; which requires</l>
                    <l>Collateral love, and dearest amity.</l>
                    <l>Thou in thy secresy although alone,</l>
                    <l>Best with thyself accompanied, seekest not</l>
                    <l>Social communication; yet, so pleased,</l>
                    <l>Canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt</l>
                    <l>Of union or communion, deified:</l>
                    <l>I, by conversing, cannot these erect</l>
                    <l>From prone; nor in their ways complacence find.</l>
                    <l>Thus I emboldened spake, and freedom used</l>
                    <l>Permissive, and acceptance found; which gained</l>
                    <l>This answer from the gracious Voice Divine.</l>
                    <l>Thus far to try thee, Adam, I was pleased;</l>
                    <l>And find thee knowing, not of beasts alone,</l>
                    <l>Which thou hast rightly named, but of thyself;</l>
                    <l>Expressing well the spirit within thee free,</l>
                    <l>My image, not imparted to the brute;</l>
                    <l>Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee</l>
                    <l>Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike;</l>
                    <l>And be so minded still: I, ere thou spakest,</l>
                    <l>Knew it not good for Man to be alone;</l>
                    <l>And no such company as then thou sawest</l>
                    <l>Intended thee; for trial only brought,</l>
                    <l>To see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet:</l>
                    <l>What next I bring shall please thee, be assured,</l>
                    <l>Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,</l>
                    <l>Thy wish exactly to thy heart’s desire.</l>
                    <l>He ended, or I heard no more; for now</l>
                    <l>My earthly by his heavenly overpowered,</l>
                    <l>Which it had long stood under, strained to the highth</l>
                    <l>In that celestial colloquy sublime,</l>
                    <l>As with an object that excels the sense</l>
                    <l>Dazzled and spent, sunk down; and sought repair</l>
                    <l>Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, called</l>
                    <l>By Nature as in aid, and closed mine eyes.</l>
                    <l>Mine eyes he closed, but open left the cell</l>
                    <l>Of fancy, my internal sight; by which,</l>
                    <l>Abstract as in a trance, methought I saw,</l>
                    <l>Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape</l>
                    <l>Still glorious before whom awake I stood:</l>
                    <l>Who stooping opened my left side, and took</l>
                    <l>From thence a rib, with cordial spirits warm,</l>
                    <l>And life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,</l>
                    <l>But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed:</l>
                    <l>The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands;</l>
                    <l>Under his forming hands a creature grew,</l>
                    <l>Man-like, but different sex; so lovely fair,</l>
                    <l>That what seemed fair in all the world, seemed now</l>
                    <l>Mean, or in her summed up, in her contained</l>
                    <l>And in her looks; which from that time infused</l>
                    <l>Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before,</l>
                    <l>And into all things from her air inspired</l>
                    <l>The spirit of love and amorous delight.</l>
                    <l>She disappeared, and left me dark; I waked</l>
                    <l>To find her, or for ever to deplore</l>
                    <l>Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure:</l>
                    <l>When out of hope, behold her, not far off,</l>
                    <l>Such as I saw her in my dream, adorned</l>
                    <l>With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow</l>
                    <l>To make her amiable: On she came,</l>
                    <l>Led by her heavenly Maker, though unseen,</l>
                    <l>And guided by his voice; nor uninformed</l>
                    <l>Of nuptial sanctity, and marriage rites:</l>
                    <l>Grace was in all her steps, Heaven in her eye,</l>
                    <l>In every gesture dignity and love.</l>
                    <l>I, overjoyed, could not forbear aloud.</l>
                    <l>This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfilled</l>
                    <l>Thy words, Creator bounteous and benign,</l>
                    <l>Giver of all things fair! but fairest this</l>
                    <l>Of all thy gifts! nor enviest. I now see</l>
                    <l>Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, myself</l>
                    <l>Before me: Woman is her name; of Man</l>
                    <l>Extracted: for this cause he shall forego</l>
                    <l>Father and mother, and to his wife adhere;</l>
                    <l>And they shall be one flesh, one heart, one soul.</l>
                    <l>She heard me thus; and though divinely brought,</l>
                    <l>Yet innocence, and virgin modesty,</l>
                    <l>Her virtue, and the conscience of her worth,</l>
                    <l>That would be wooed, and not unsought be won,</l>
                    <l>Not obvious, not obtrusive, but, retired,</l>
                    <l>The more desirable; or, to say all,</l>
                    <l>Nature herself, though pure of sinful thought,</l>
                    <l>Wrought in her so, that, seeing me, she turned:</l>
                    <l>I followed her; she what was honour knew,</l>
                    <l>And with obsequious majesty approved</l>
                    <l>My pleaded reason. To the nuptial bower</l>
                    <l>I led her blushing like the morn: All Heaven,</l>
                    <l>And happy constellations, on that hour</l>
                    <l>Shed their selectest influence; the Earth</l>
                    <l>Gave sign of gratulation, and each hill;</l>
                    <l>Joyous the birds; fresh gales and gentle airs</l>
                    <l>Whispered it to the woods, and from their wings</l>
                    <l>Flung rose, flung odours from the spicy shrub,</l>
                    <l>Disporting, till the amorous bird of night</l>
                    <l>Sung spousal, and bid haste the evening-star</l>
                    <l>On his hill top, to light the bridal lamp.</l>
                    <l>Thus have I told thee all my state, and brought</l>
                    <l>My story to the sum of earthly bliss,</l>
                    <l>Which I enjoy; and must confess to find</l>
                    <l>In all things else delight indeed, but such</l>
                    <l>As, used or not, works in the mind no change,</l>
                    <l>Nor vehement desire; these delicacies</l>
                    <l>I mean of taste, sight, smell, herbs, fruits, and flowers,</l>
                    <l>Walks, and the melody of birds: but here</l>
                    <l>Far otherwise, transported I behold,</l>
                    <l>Transported touch; here passion first I felt,</l>
                    <l>Commotion strange! in all enjoyments else</l>
                    <l>Superiour and unmoved; here only weak</l>
                    <l>Against the charm of Beauty’s powerful glance.</l>
                    <l>Or Nature failed in me, and left some part</l>
                    <l>Not proof enough such object to sustain;</l>
                    <l>Or, from my side subducting, took perhaps</l>
                    <l>More than enough; at least on her bestowed</l>
                    <l>Too much of ornament, in outward show</l>
                    <l>Elaborate, of inward less exact.</l>
                    <l>For well I understand in the prime end</l>
                    <l>Of Nature her the inferiour, in the mind</l>
                    <l>And inward faculties, which most excel;</l>
                    <l>In outward also her resembling less</l>
                    <l>His image who made both, and less expressing</l>
                    <l>The character of that dominion given</l>
                    <l>O’er other creatures: Yet when I approach</l>
                    <l>Her loveliness, so absolute she seems</l>
                    <l>And in herself complete, so well to know</l>
                    <l>Her own, that what she wills to do or say,</l>
                    <l>Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best:</l>
                    <l>All higher knowledge in her presence falls</l>
                    <l>Degraded; Wisdom in discourse with her</l>
                    <l>Loses discountenanced, and like Folly shows;</l>
                    <l>Authority and Reason on her wait,</l>
                    <l>As one intended first, not after made</l>
                    <l>Occasionally; and, to consummate all,</l>
                    <l>Greatness of mind and Nobleness their seat</l>
                    <l>Build in her loveliest, and create an awe</l>
                    <l>About her, as a guard angelick placed.</l>
                    <l>To whom the Angel with contracted brow.</l>
                    <l>Accuse not Nature, she hath done her part;</l>
                    <l>Do thou but thine; and be not diffident</l>
                    <l>Of Wisdom; she deserts thee not, if thou</l>
                    <l>Dismiss not her, when most thou needest her nigh,</l>
                    <l>By attributing overmuch to things</l>
                    <l>Less excellent, as thou thyself perceivest.</l>
                    <l>For, what admirest thou, what transports thee so,</l>
                    <l>An outside? fair, no doubt, and worthy well</l>
                    <l>Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love;</l>
                    <l>Not thy subjection: Weigh with her thyself;</l>
                    <l>Then value: Oft-times nothing profits more</l>
                    <l>Than self-esteem, grounded on just and right</l>
                    <l>Well managed; of that skill the more thou knowest,</l>
                    <l>The more she will acknowledge thee her head,</l>
                    <l>And to realities yield all her shows:</l>
                    <l>Made so adorn for thy delight the more,</l>
                    <l>So awful, that with honour thou mayest love</l>
                    <l>Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise.</l>
                    <l>But if the sense of touch, whereby mankind</l>
                    <l>Is propagated, seem such dear delight</l>
                    <l>Beyond all other; think the same vouchsafed</l>
                    <l>To cattle and each beast; which would not be</l>
                    <l>To them made common and divulged, if aught</l>
                    <l>Therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue</l>
                    <l>The soul of man, or passion in him move.</l>
                    <l>What higher in her society thou findest</l>
                    <l>Attractive, human, rational, love still;</l>
                    <l>In loving thou dost well, in passion not,</l>
                    <l>Wherein true love consists not: Love refines</l>
                    <l>The thoughts, and heart enlarges; hath his seat</l>
                    <l>In reason, and is judicious; is the scale</l>
                    <l>By which to heavenly love thou mayest ascend,</l>
                    <l>Not sunk in carnal pleasure; for which cause,</l>
                    <l>Among the beasts no mate for thee was found.</l>
                    <l>To whom thus, half abashed, Adam replied.</l>
                    <l>Neither her outside formed so fair, nor aught</l>
                    <l>In procreation common to all kinds,</l>
                    <l>(Though higher of the genial bed by far,</l>
                    <l>And with mysterious reverence I deem,)</l>
                    <l>So much delights me, as those graceful acts,</l>
                    <l>Those thousand decencies, that daily flow</l>
                    <l>From all her words and actions mixed with love</l>
                    <l>And sweet compliance, which declare unfeigned</l>
                    <l>Union of mind, or in us both one soul;</l>
                    <l>Harmony to behold in wedded pair</l>
                    <l>More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear.</l>
                    <l>Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose</l>
                    <l>What inward thence I feel, not therefore foiled,</l>
                    <l>Who meet with various objects, from the sense</l>
                    <l>Variously representing; yet, still free,</l>
                    <l>Approve the best, and follow what I approve.</l>
                    <l>To love, thou blamest me not; for Love, thou sayest,</l>
                    <l>Leads up to Heaven, is both the way and guide;</l>
                    <l>Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask:</l>
                    <l>Love not the heavenly Spirits, and how their love</l>
                    <l>Express they? by looks only? or do they mix</l>
                    <l>Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?</l>
                    <l>To whom the Angel, with a smile that glowed</l>
                    <l>Celestial rosy red, Love’s proper hue,</l>
                    <l>Answered. Let it suffice thee that thou knowest</l>
                    <l>Us happy, and without love no happiness.</l>
                    <l>Whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest,</l>
                    <l>(And pure thou wert created) we enjoy</l>
                    <l>In eminence; and obstacle find none</l>
                    <l>Of membrane, joint, or limb, exclusive bars;</l>
                    <l>Easier than air with air, if Spirits embrace,</l>
                    <l>Total they mix, union of pure with pure</l>
                    <l>Desiring, nor restrained conveyance need,</l>
                    <l>As flesh to mix with flesh, or soul with soul.</l>
                    <l>But I can now no more; the parting sun</l>
                    <l>Beyond the Earth’s green Cape and verdant Isles</l>
                    <l>Hesperian sets, my signal to depart.</l>
                    <l>Be strong, live happy, and love! But, first of all,</l>
                    <l>Him, whom to love is to obey, and keep</l>
                    <l>His great command; take heed lest passion sway</l>
                    <l>Thy judgement to do aught, which else free will</l>
                    <l>Would not admit: thine, and of all thy sons,</l>
                    <l>The weal or woe in thee is placed; beware!</l>
                    <l>I in thy persevering shall rejoice,</l>
                    <l>And all the Blest: Stand fast; to stand or fall</l>
                    <l>Free in thine own arbitrement it lies.</l>
                    <l>Perfect within, no outward aid require;</l>
                    <l>And all temptation to transgress repel.</l>
                    <l>So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus</l>
                    <l>Followed with benediction. Since to part,</l>
                    <l>Go, heavenly guest, ethereal Messenger,</l>
                    <l>Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore!</l>
                    <l>Gentle to me and affable hath been</l>
                    <l>Thy condescension, and shall be honoured ever</l>
                    <l>With grateful memory: Thou to mankind</l>
                    <l>Be good and friendly still, and oft return!</l>
                    <l>So parted they; the Angel up to Heaven</l>
                    <l>From the thick shade, and Adam to his bower.</l>

                    <l>Impresses quaint, caparisons and steeds,</l>
                    <l>Bases and tinsel trappings, gorgeous knights</l>
                    <l>At joust and tournament; then marshall’d feast</l>
                    <l>Serv’d up in hall with sewers and seneshals;</l>
                    <l>The skill of artifice or office mean,</l>
                    <l>Not that which justly gives heroick name</l>
                    <l>To person, or to poem. Me, of these</l>
                    <l>Nor skill’d nor studious, higher argument</l>
                    <l>Remains; sufficient of itself to raise</l>
                    <l>That name, unless an age too late, or cold</l>
                    <l>Climate, or years, damp my intended wing</l>
                    <l>Depress’d; and much they may, if all be mine,</l>
                    <l>Not hers, who brings it nightly to my ear.</l>
                    <l>The sun was sunk, and after him the star</l>
                    <l>Of Hesperus, whose office is to bring</l>
                    <l>Twilight upon the earth, short arbiter</l>
                    <l>’Twixt day and night, and now from end to end</l>
                    <l>Night’s hemisphere had veil’d the horizon round:</l>
                    <l>When satan, who late fled before the threats</l>
                    <l>Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improv’d</l>
                    <l>In meditated fraud and malice, bent</l>
                    <l>On Man’s destruction, maugre what might hap</l>
                    <l>Of heavier on himself, fearless returned</l>
                    <l>By night he fled, and at midnight returned</l>
                    <l>From compassing the earth; cautious of day,</l>
                    <l>Since Uriel, regent of the sun, descried</l>
                    <l>His entrance, and foreworned the Cherubim</l>
                    <l>That kept their watch; thence full of anguish driven,</l>
                    <l>The space of seven continued nights he rode</l>
                    <l>With darkness; thrice the equinoctial line</l>
                    <l>He circled; four times crossed the car of night</l>
                    <l>From pole to pole, traversing each colure;</l>
                    <l>On the eighth returned; and, on the coast averse</l>
                    <l>From entrance or Cherubick watch, by stealth</l>
                    <l>Found unsuspected way. There was a place,</l>
                    <l>Now not, though sin, not time, first wrought the change,</l>
                    <l>Where Tigris, at the foot of Paradise,</l>
                    <l>Into a gulf shot under ground, till part</l>
                    <l>Rose up a fountain by the tree of life:</l>
                    <l>In with the river sunk, and with it rose</l>
                    <l>Satan, involved in rising mist; then sought</l>
                    <l>Where to lie hid; sea he had searched, and land,</l>
                    <l>From Eden over Pontus and the pool</l>
                    <l>Maeotis, up beyond the river Ob;</l>
                    <l>Downward as far antarctick; and in length,</l>
                    <l>West from Orontes to the ocean barred</l>
                    <l>At Darien; thence to the land where flows</l>
                    <l>Ganges and Indus: Thus the orb he roamed</l>
                    <l>With narrow search; and with inspection deep</l>
                    <l>Considered every creature, which of all</l>
                    <l>Most opportune might serve his wiles; and found</l>
                    <l>The Serpent subtlest beast of all the field.</l>
                    <l>Him after long debate, irresolute</l>
                    <l>Of thoughts revolved, his final sentence chose</l>
                    <l>Fit vessel, fittest imp of fraud, in whom</l>
                    <l>To enter, and his dark suggestions hide</l>
                    <l>From sharpest sight: for, in the wily snake</l>
                    <l>Whatever sleights, none would suspicious mark,</l>
                    <l>As from his wit and native subtlety</l>
                    <l>Proceeding; which, in other beasts observed,</l>
                    <l>Doubt might beget of diabolick power</l>
                    <l>Active within, beyond the sense of brute.</l>
                    <l>Thus he resolved, but first from inward grief</l>
                    <l>His bursting passion into plaints thus poured.</l>
                    <l>More justly, seat worthier of Gods, as built</l>
                    <l>With second thoughts, reforming what was old!</l>
                    <l>O Earth, how like to Heaven, if not preferred</l>
                    <l>For what God, after better, worse would build?</l>
                    <l>Terrestrial Heaven, danced round by other Heavens</l>
                    <l>That shine, yet bear their bright officious lamps,</l>
                    <l>Light above light, for thee alone, as seems,</l>
                    <l>In thee concentring all their precious beams</l>
                    <l>Of sacred influence! As God in Heaven</l>
                    <l>Is center, yet extends to all; so thou,</l>
                    <l>Centring, receivest from all those orbs: in thee,</l>
                    <l>Not in themselves, all their known virtue appears</l>
                    <l>Productive in herb, plant, and nobler birth</l>
                    <l>Of creatures animate with gradual life</l>
                    <l>Of growth, sense, reason, all summed up in Man.</l>
                    <l>With what delight could I have walked thee round,</l>
                    <l>If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange</l>
                    <l>Of hill, and valley, rivers, woods, and plains,</l>
                    <l>Now land, now sea and shores with forest crowned,</l>
                    <l>Rocks, dens, and caves! But I in none of these</l>
                    <l>Find place or refuge; and the more I see</l>
                    <l>Pleasures about me, so much more I feel</l>
                    <l>Torment within me, as from the hateful siege</l>
                    <l>Of contraries: all good to me becomes</l>
                    <l>Bane, and in Heaven much worse would be my state.</l>
                    <l>But neither here seek I, no nor in Heaven</l>
                    <l>To dwell, unless by mastering Heaven’s Supreme;</l>
                    <l>Nor hope to be myself less miserable</l>
                    <l>By what I seek, but others to make such</l>
                    <l>As I, though thereby worse to me redound:</l>
                    <l>For only in destroying I find ease</l>
                    <l>To my relentless thoughts; and, him destroyed,</l>
                    <l>Or won to what may work his utter loss,</l>
                    <l>For whom all this was made, all this will soon</l>
                    <l>Follow, as to him linked in weal or woe;</l>
                    <l>In woe then; that destruction wide may range:</l>
                    <l>To me shall be the glory sole among</l>
                    <l>The infernal Powers, in one day to have marred</l>
                    <l>What he, Almighty styled, six nights and days</l>
                    <l>Continued making; and who knows how long</l>
                    <l>Before had been contriving? though perhaps</l>
                    <l>Not longer than since I, in one night, freed</l>
                    <l>From servitude inglorious well nigh half</l>
                    <l>The angelick name, and thinner left the throng</l>
                    <l>Of his adorers: He, to be avenged,</l>
                    <l>And to repair his numbers thus impaired,</l>
                    <l>Whether such virtue spent of old now failed</l>
                    <l>More Angels to create, if they at least</l>
                    <l>Are his created, or, to spite us more,</l>
                    <l>Determined to advance into our room</l>
                    <l>A creature formed of earth, and him endow,</l>
                    <l>Exalted from so base original,</l>
                    <l>With heavenly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed,</l>
                    <l>He effected; Man he made, and for him built</l>
                    <l>Magnificent this world, and earth his seat,</l>
                    <l>Him lord pronounced; and, O indignity!</l>
                    <l>Subjected to his service angel-wings,</l>
                    <l>And flaming ministers to watch and tend</l>
                    <l>Their earthly charge: Of these the vigilance</l>
                    <l>I dread; and, to elude, thus wrapt in mist</l>
                    <l>Of midnight vapour glide obscure, and pry</l>
                    <l>In every bush and brake, where hap may find</l>
                    <l>The serpent sleeping; in whose mazy folds</l>
                    <l>To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.</l>
                    <l>O foul descent! that I, who erst contended</l>
                    <l>With Gods to sit the highest, am now constrained</l>
                    <l>Into a beast; and, mixed with bestial slime,</l>
                    <l>This essence to incarnate and imbrute,</l>
                    <l>That to the highth of Deity aspired!</l>
                    <l>But what will not ambition and revenge</l>
                    <l>Descend to? Who aspires, must down as low</l>
                    <l>As high he soared; obnoxious, first or last,</l>
                    <l>To basest things. Revenge, at first though sweet,</l>
                    <l>Bitter ere long, back on itself recoils:</l>
                    <l>Let it; I reck not, so it light well aimed,</l>
                    <l>Since higher I fall short, on him who next</l>
                    <l>Provokes my envy, this new favourite</l>
                    <l>Of Heaven, this man of clay, son of despite,</l>
                    <l>Whom, us the more to spite, his Maker raised</l>
                    <l>From dust: Spite then with spite is best repaid.</l>
                    <l>So saying, through each thicket dank or dry,</l>
                    <l>Like a black mist low-creeping, he held on</l>
                    <l>His midnight-search, where soonest he might find</l>
                    <l>The serpent; him fast-sleeping soon he found</l>
                    <l>In labyrinth of many a round self-rolled,</l>
                    <l>His head the midst, well stored with subtile wiles:</l>
                    <l>Not yet in horrid shade or dismal den,</l>
                    <l>Nor nocent yet; but, on the grassy herb,</l>
                    <l>Fearless unfeared he slept: in at his mouth</l>
                    <l>The Devil entered; and his brutal sense,</l>
                    <l>In heart or head, possessing, soon inspired</l>
                    <l>With act intelligential; but his sleep</l>
                    <l>Disturbed not, waiting close the approach of morn.</l>
                    <l>Now, when as sacred light began to dawn</l>
                    <l>In Eden on the humid flowers, that breathed</l>
                    <l>Their morning incense, when all things, that breathe,</l>
                    <l>From the Earth’s great altar send up silent praise</l>
                    <l>To the Creator, and his nostrils fill</l>
                    <l>With grateful smell, forth came the human pair,</l>
                    <l>And joined their vocal worship to the quire</l>
                    <l>Of creatures wanting voice; that done, partake</l>
                    <l>The season prime for sweetest scents and airs:</l>
                    <l>Then commune, how that day they best may ply</l>
                    <l>Their growing work: for much their work out-grew</l>
                    <l>The hands’ dispatch of two gardening so wide,</l>
                    <l>And Eve first to her husband thus began.</l>
                    <l>Adam, well may we labour still to dress</l>
                    <l>This garden, still to tend plant, herb, and flower,</l>
                    <l>Our pleasant task enjoined; but, till more hands</l>
                    <l>Aid us, the work under our labour grows,</l>
                    <l>Luxurious by restraint; what we by day</l>
                    <l>Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,</l>
                    <l>One night or two with wanton growth derides</l>
                    <l>Tending to wild. Thou therefore now advise,</l>
                    <l>Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present:</l>
                    <l>Let us divide our labours; thou, where choice</l>
                    <l>Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind</l>
                    <l>The woodbine round this arbour, or direct</l>
                    <l>The clasping ivy where to climb; while I,</l>
                    <l>In yonder spring of roses intermixed</l>
                    <l>With myrtle, find what to redress till noon:</l>
                    <l>For, while so near each other thus all day</l>
                    <l>Our task we choose, what wonder if so near</l>
                    <l>Looks intervene and smiles, or object new</l>
                    <l>Casual discourse draw on; which intermits</l>
                    <l>Our day’s work, brought to little, though begun</l>
                    <l>Early, and the hour of supper comes unearned?</l>
                    <l>To whom mild answer Adam thus returned.</l>
                    <l>Sole Eve, associate sole, to me beyond</l>
                    <l>Compare above all living creatures dear!</l>
                    <l>Well hast thou motioned, well thy thoughts employed,</l>
                    <l>How we might best fulfil the work which here</l>
                    <l>God hath assigned us; nor of me shalt pass</l>
                    <l>Unpraised: for nothing lovelier can be found</l>
                    <l>In woman, than to study houshold good,</l>
                    <l>And good works in her husband to promote.</l>
                    <l>Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed</l>
                    <l>Labour, as to debar us when we need</l>
                    <l>Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,</l>
                    <l>Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse</l>
                    <l>Of looks and smiles; for smiles from reason flow,</l>
                    <l>To brute denied, and are of love the food;</l>
                    <l>Love, not the lowest end of human life.</l>
                    <l>For not to irksome toil, but to delight,</l>
                    <l>He made us, and delight to reason joined.</l>
                    <l>These paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands</l>
                    <l>Will keep from wilderness with ease, as wide</l>
                    <l>As we need walk, till younger hands ere long</l>
                    <l>Assist us; But, if much converse perhaps</l>
                    <l>Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield:</l>
                    <l>For solitude sometimes is best society,</l>
                    <l>And short retirement urges sweet return.</l>
                    <l>But other doubt possesses me, lest harm</l>
                    <l>Befall thee severed from me; for thou knowest</l>
                    <l>What hath been warned us, what malicious foe</l>
                    <l>Envying our happiness, and of his own</l>
                    <l>Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame</l>
                    <l>By sly assault; and somewhere nigh at hand</l>
                    <l>Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find</l>
                    <l>His wish and best advantage, us asunder;</l>
                    <l>Hopeless to circumvent us joined, where each</l>
                    <l>To other speedy aid might lend at need:</l>
                    <l>Whether his first design be to withdraw</l>
                    <l>Our fealty from God, or to disturb</l>
                    <l>Conjugal love, than which perhaps no bliss</l>
                    <l>Enjoyed by us excites his envy more;</l>
                    <l>Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side</l>
                    <l>That gave thee being, still shades thee, and protects.</l>
                    <l>The wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,</l>
                    <l>Safest and seemliest by her husband stays,</l>
                    <l>Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.</l>
                    <l>To whom the virgin majesty of Eve,</l>
                    <l>As one who loves, and some unkindness meets,</l>
                    <l>With sweet austere composure thus replied.</l>
                    <l>Offspring of Heaven and Earth, and all Earth’s Lord!</l>
                    <l>That such an enemy we have, who seeks</l>
                    <l>Our ruin, both by thee informed I learn,</l>
                    <l>And from the parting Angel over-heard,</l>
                    <l>As in a shady nook I stood behind,</l>
                    <l>Just then returned at shut of evening flowers.</l>
                    <l>But, that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt</l>
                    <l>To God or thee, because we have a foe</l>
                    <l>May tempt it, I expected not to hear.</l>
                    <l>His violence thou fearest not, being such</l>
                    <l>As we, not capable of death or pain,</l>
                    <l>Can either not receive, or can repel.</l>
                    <l>His fraud is then thy fear; which plain infers</l>
                    <l>Thy equal fear, that my firm faith and love</l>
                    <l>Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced;</l>
                    <l>Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy breast,</l>
                    <l>Adam, mis-thought of her to thee so dear?</l>
                    <l>To whom with healing words Adam replied.</l>
                    <l>Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve!</l>
                    <l>For such thou art; from sin and blame entire:</l>
                    <l>Not diffident of thee do I dissuade</l>
                    <l>Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid</l>
                    <l>The attempt itself, intended by our foe.</l>
                    <l>For he who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses</l>
                    <l>The tempted with dishonour foul; supposed</l>
                    <l>Not incorruptible of faith, not proof</l>
                    <l>Against temptation: Thou thyself with scorn</l>
                    <l>And anger wouldst resent the offered wrong,</l>
                    <l>Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then,</l>
                    <l>If such affront I labour to avert</l>
                    <l>From thee alone, which on us both at once</l>
                    <l>The enemy, though bold, will hardly dare;</l>
                    <l>Or daring, first on me the assault shall light.</l>
                    <l>Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn;</l>
                    <l>Subtle he needs must be, who could seduce</l>
                    <l>Angels; nor think superfluous other’s aid.</l>
                    <l>I, from the influence of thy looks, receive</l>
                    <l>Access in every virtue; in thy sight</l>
                    <l>More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were</l>
                    <l>Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on,</l>
                    <l>Shame to be overcome or over-reached,</l>
                    <l>Would utmost vigour raise, and raised unite.</l>
                    <l>Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel</l>
                    <l>When I am present, and thy trial choose</l>
                    <l>With me, best witness of thy virtue tried?</l>
                    <l>So spake domestick Adam in his care</l>
                    <l>And matrimonial love; but Eve, who thought</l>
                    <l>Less attributed to her faith sincere,</l>
                    <l>Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed.</l>
                    <l>If this be our condition, thus to dwell</l>
                    <l>In narrow circuit straitened by a foe,</l>
                    <l>Subtle or violent, we not endued</l>
                    <l>Single with like defence, wherever met;</l>
                    <l>How are we happy, still in fear of harm?</l>
                    <l>But harm precedes not sin: only our foe,</l>
                    <l>Tempting, affronts us with his foul esteem</l>
                    <l>Of our integrity: his foul esteem</l>
                    <l>Sticks no dishonour on our front, but turns</l>
                    <l>Foul on himself; then wherefore shunned or feared</l>
                    <l>By us? who rather double honour gain</l>
                    <l>From his surmise proved false; find peace within,</l>
                    <l>Favour from Heaven, our witness, from the event.</l>
                    <l>And what is faith, love, virtue, unassayed</l>
                    <l>Alone, without exteriour help sustained?</l>
                    <l>Let us not then suspect our happy state</l>
                    <l>Left so imperfect by the Maker wise,</l>
                    <l>As not secure to single or combined.</l>
                    <l>Frail is our happiness, if this be so,</l>
                    <l>And Eden were no Eden, thus exposed.</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Adam fervently replied.</l>
                    <l>O Woman, best are all things as the will</l>
                    <l>Of God ordained them: His creating hand</l>
                    <l>Nothing imperfect or deficient left</l>
                    <l>Of all that he created, much less Man,</l>
                    <l>Or aught that might his happy state secure,</l>
                    <l>Secure from outward force; within himself</l>
                    <l>The danger lies, yet lies within his power:</l>
                    <l>Against his will he can receive no harm.</l>
                    <l>But God left free the will; for what obeys</l>
                    <l>Reason, is free; and Reason he made right,</l>
                    <l>But bid her well be ware, and still erect;</l>
                    <l>Lest, by some fair-appearing good surprised,</l>
                    <l>She dictate false; and mis-inform the will</l>
                    <l>To do what God expressly hath forbid.</l>
                    <l>Not then mistrust, but tender love, enjoins,</l>
                    <l>That I should mind thee oft; and mind thou me.</l>
                    <l>Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve;</l>
                    <l>Since Reason not impossibly may meet</l>
                    <l>Some specious object by the foe suborned,</l>
                    <l>And fall into deception unaware,</l>
                    <l>Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warned.</l>
                    <l>Seek not temptation then, which to avoid</l>
                    <l>Were better, and most likely if from me</l>
                    <l>Thou sever not: Trial will come unsought.</l>
                    <l>Wouldst thou approve thy constancy, approve</l>
                    <l>First thy obedience; the other who can know,</l>
                    <l>Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?</l>
                    <l>But, if thou think, trial unsought may find</l>
                    <l>Us both securer than thus warned thou seemest,</l>
                    <l>Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more;</l>
                    <l>Go in thy native innocence, rely</l>
                    <l>On what thou hast of virtue; summon all!</l>
                    <l>For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine.</l>
                    <l>So spake the patriarch of mankind; but Eve</l>
                    <l>Persisted; yet submiss, though last, replied.</l>
                    <l>With thy permission then, and thus forewarned</l>
                    <l>Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words</l>
                    <l>Touched only; that our trial, when least sought,</l>
                    <l>May find us both perhaps far less prepared,</l>
                    <l>The willinger I go, nor much expect</l>
                    <l>A foe so proud will first the weaker seek;</l>
                    <l>So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.</l>
                    <l>Thus saying, from her husband’s hand her hand</l>
                    <l>Soft she withdrew; and, like a Wood-Nymph light,</l>
                    <l>Oread or Dryad, or of Delia’s train,</l>
                    <l>Betook her to the groves; but Delia’s self</l>
                    <l>In gait surpassed, and Goddess-like deport,</l>
                    <l>Though not as she with bow and quiver armed,</l>
                    <l>But with such gardening tools as Art yet rude,</l>
                    <l>Guiltless of fire, had formed, or Angels brought.</l>
                    <l>To Pales, or Pomona, thus adorned,</l>
                    <l>Likest she seemed, Pomona when she fled</l>
                    <l>Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her prime,</l>
                    <l>Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove.</l>
                    <l>Her long with ardent look his eye pursued</l>
                    <l>Delighted, but desiring more her stay.</l>
                    <l>Oft he to her his charge of quick return</l>
                    <l>Repeated; she to him as oft engaged</l>
                    <l>To be returned by noon amid the bower,</l>
                    <l>And all things in best order to invite</l>
                    <l>Noontide repast, or afternoon’s repose.</l>
                    <l>O much deceived, much failing, hapless Eve,</l>
                    <l>Of thy presumed return! event perverse!</l>
                    <l>Thou never from that hour in Paradise</l>
                    <l>Foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose;</l>
                    <l>Such ambush, hid among sweet flowers and shades,</l>
                    <l>Waited with hellish rancour imminent</l>
                    <l>To intercept thy way, or send thee back</l>
                    <l>Despoiled of innocence, of faith, of bliss!</l>
                    <l>For now, and since first break of dawn, the Fiend,</l>
                    <l>Mere serpent in appearance, forth was come;</l>
                    <l>And on his quest, where likeliest he might find</l>
                    <l>The only two of mankind, but in them</l>
                    <l>The whole included race, his purposed prey.</l>
                    <l>In bower and field he sought, where any tuft</l>
                    <l>Of grove or garden-plot more pleasant lay,</l>
                    <l>Their tendance, or plantation for delight;</l>
                    <l>By fountain or by shady rivulet</l>
                    <l>He sought them both, but wished his hap might find</l>
                    <l>Eve separate; he wished, but not with hope</l>
                    <l>Of what so seldom chanced; when to his wish,</l>
                    <l>Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies,</l>
                    <l>Veiled in a cloud of fragrance, where she stood,</l>
                    <l>Half spied, so thick the roses blushing round</l>
                    <l>About her glowed, oft stooping to support</l>
                    <l>Each flower of slender stalk, whose head, though gay</l>
                    <l>Carnation, purple, azure, or specked with gold,</l>
                    <l>Hung drooping unsustained; them she upstays</l>
                    <l>Gently with myrtle band, mindless the while</l>
                    <l>Herself, though fairest unsupported flower,</l>
                    <l>From her best prop so far, and storm so nigh.</l>
                    <l>Nearer he drew, and many a walk traversed</l>
                    <l>Of stateliest covert, cedar, pine, or palm;</l>
                    <l>Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen,</l>
                    <l>Among thick-woven arborets, and flowers</l>
                    <l>Imbordered on each bank, the hand of Eve:</l>
                    <l>Spot more delicious than those gardens feigned</l>
                    <l>Or of revived Adonis, or renowned</l>
                    <l>Alcinous, host of old Laertes’ son;</l>
                    <l>Or that, not mystick, where the sapient king</l>
                    <l>Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian spouse.</l>
                    <l>Much he the place admired, the person more.</l>
                    <l>As one who long in populous city pent,</l>
                    <l>Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air,</l>
                    <l>Forth issuing on a summer’s morn, to breathe</l>
                    <l>Among the pleasant villages and farms</l>
                    <l>Adjoined, from each thing met conceives delight;</l>
                    <l>The smell of grain, or tedded grass, or kine,</l>
                    <l>Or dairy, each rural sight, each rural sound;</l>
                    <l>If chance, with nymph-like step, fair virgin pass,</l>
                    <l>What pleasing seemed, for her now pleases more;</l>
                    <l>She most, and in her look sums all delight:</l>
                    <l>Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold</l>
                    <l>This flowery plat, the sweet recess of Eve</l>
                    <l>Thus early, thus alone: Her heavenly form</l>
                    <l>Angelick, but more soft, and feminine,</l>
                    <l>Her graceful innocence, her every air</l>
                    <l>Of gesture, or least action, overawed</l>
                    <l>His malice, and with rapine sweet bereaved</l>
                    <l>His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:</l>
                    <l>That space the Evil-one abstracted stood</l>
                    <l>From his own evil, and for the time remained</l>
                    <l>Stupidly good; of enmity disarmed,</l>
                    <l>Of guile, of hate, of envy, of revenge:</l>
                    <l>But the hot Hell that always in him burns,</l>
                    <l>Though in mid Heaven, soon ended his delight,</l>
                    <l>And tortures him now more, the more he sees</l>
                    <l>Of pleasure, not for him ordained: then soon</l>
                    <l>Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts</l>
                    <l>Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.</l>
                    <l>Thoughts, whither have ye led me! with what sweet</l>
                    <l>Compulsion thus transported, to forget</l>
                    <l>What hither brought us! hate, not love; nor hope</l>
                    <l>Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste</l>
                    <l>Of pleasure; but all pleasure to destroy,</l>
                    <l>Save what is in destroying; other joy</l>
                    <l>To me is lost. Then, let me not let pass</l>
                    <l>Occasion which now smiles; behold alone</l>
                    <l>The woman, opportune to all attempts,</l>
                    <l>Her husband, for I view far round, not nigh,</l>
                    <l>Whose higher intellectual more I shun,</l>
                    <l>And strength, of courage haughty, and of limb</l>
                    <l>Heroick built, though of terrestrial mould;</l>
                    <l>Foe not informidable! exempt from wound,</l>
                    <l>I not; so much hath Hell debased, and pain</l>
                    <l>Enfeebled me, to what I was in Heaven.</l>
                    <l>She fair, divinely fair, fit love for Gods!</l>
                    <l>Not terrible, though terrour be in love</l>
                    <l>And beauty, not approached by stronger hate,</l>
                    <l>Hate stronger, under show of love well feigned;</l>
                    <l>The way which to her ruin now I tend.</l>
                    <l>So spake the enemy of mankind, enclosed</l>
                    <l>In serpent, inmate bad! and toward Eve</l>
                    <l>Addressed his way: not with indented wave,</l>
                    <l>Prone on the ground, as since; but on his rear,</l>
                    <l>Circular base of rising folds, that towered</l>
                    <l>Fold above fold, a surging maze! his head</l>
                    <l>Crested aloft, and carbuncle his eyes;</l>
                    <l>With burnished neck of verdant gold, erect</l>
                    <l>Amidst his circling spires, that on the grass</l>
                    <l>Floated redundant: pleasing was his shape</l>
                    <l>And lovely; never since of serpent-kind</l>
                    <l>Lovelier, not those that in Illyria changed,</l>
                    <l>Hermione and Cadmus, or the god</l>
                    <l>In Epidaurus; nor to which transformed</l>
                    <l>Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline, was seen;</l>
                    <l>He with Olympias; this with her who bore</l>
                    <l>Scipio, the highth of Rome. With tract oblique</l>
                    <l>At first, as one who sought access, but feared</l>
                    <l>To interrupt, side-long he works his way.</l>
                    <l>As when a ship, by skilful steersmen wrought</l>
                    <l>Nigh river’s mouth or foreland, where the wind</l>
                    <l>Veers oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her sail:</l>
                    <l>So varied he, and of his tortuous train</l>
                    <l>Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve,</l>
                    <l>To lure her eye; she, busied, heard the sound</l>
                    <l>Of rusling leaves, but minded not, as used</l>
                    <l>To such disport before her through the field,</l>
                    <l>From every beast; more duteous at her call,</l>
                    <l>Than at Circean call the herd disguised.</l>
                    <l>He, bolder now, uncalled before her stood,</l>
                    <l>But as in gaze admiring: oft he bowed</l>
                    <l>His turret crest, and sleek enamelled neck,</l>
                    <l>Fawning; and licked the ground whereon she trod.</l>
                    <l>His gentle dumb expression turned at length</l>
                    <l>The eye of Eve to mark his play; he, glad</l>
                    <l>Of her attention gained, with serpent-tongue</l>
                    <l>Organick, or impulse of vocal air,</l>
                    <l>His fraudulent temptation thus began.</l>
                    <l>Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps</l>
                    <l>Thou canst, who art sole wonder! much less arm</l>
                    <l>Thy looks, the Heaven of mildness, with disdain,</l>
                    <l>Displeased that I approach thee thus, and gaze</l>
                    <l>Insatiate; I thus single; nor have feared</l>
                    <l>Thy awful brow, more awful thus retired.</l>
                    <l>Fairest resemblance of thy Maker fair,</l>
                    <l>Thee all things living gaze on, all things thine</l>
                    <l>By gift, and thy celestial beauty adore</l>
                    <l>With ravishment beheld! there best beheld,</l>
                    <l>Where universally admired; but here</l>
                    <l>In this enclosure wild, these beasts among,</l>
                    <l>Beholders rude, and shallow to discern</l>
                    <l>Half what in thee is fair, one man except,</l>
                    <l>Who sees thee? and what is one? who should be seen</l>
                    <l>A Goddess among Gods, adored and served</l>
                    <l>By Angels numberless, thy daily train.</l>
                    <l>So glozed the Tempter, and his proem tuned:</l>
                    <l>Into the heart of Eve his words made way,</l>
                    <l>Though at the voice much marvelling; at length,</l>
                    <l>Not unamazed, she thus in answer spake.</l>
                    <l>What may this mean? language of man pronounced</l>
                    <l>By tongue of brute, and human sense expressed?</l>
                    <l>The first, at least, of these I thought denied</l>
                    <l>To beasts; whom God, on their creation-day,</l>
                    <l>Created mute to all articulate sound:</l>
                    <l>The latter I demur; for in their looks</l>
                    <l>Much reason, and in their actions, oft appears.</l>
                    <l>Thee, Serpent, subtlest beast of all the field</l>
                    <l>I knew, but not with human voice endued;</l>
                    <l>Redouble then this miracle, and say,</l>
                    <l>How camest thou speakable of mute, and how</l>
                    <l>To me so friendly grown above the rest</l>
                    <l>Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?</l>
                    <l>Say, for such wonder claims attention due.</l>
                    <l>To whom the guileful Tempter thus replied.</l>
                    <l>Empress of this fair world, resplendent Eve!</l>
                    <l>Easy to me it is to tell thee all</l>
                    <l>What thou commandest; and right thou shouldst be obeyed:</l>
                    <l>I was at first as other beasts that graze</l>
                    <l>The trodden herb, of abject thoughts and low,</l>
                    <l>As was my food; nor aught but food discerned</l>
                    <l>Or sex, and apprehended nothing high:</l>
                    <l>Till, on a day roving the field, I chanced</l>
                    <l>A goodly tree far distant to behold</l>
                    <l>Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed,</l>
                    <l>Ruddy and gold: I nearer drew to gaze;</l>
                    <l>When from the boughs a savoury odour blown,</l>
                    <l>Grateful to appetite, more pleased my sense</l>
                    <l>Than smell of sweetest fennel, or the teats</l>
                    <l>Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even,</l>
                    <l>Unsucked of lamb or kid, that tend their play.</l>
                    <l>To satisfy the sharp desire I had</l>
                    <l>Of tasting those fair apples, I resolved</l>
                    <l>Not to defer; hunger and thirst at once,</l>
                    <l>Powerful persuaders, quickened at the scent</l>
                    <l>Of that alluring fruit, urged me so keen.</l>
                    <l>About the mossy trunk I wound me soon;</l>
                    <l>For, high from ground, the branches would require</l>
                    <l>Thy utmost reach or Adam’s: Round the tree</l>
                    <l>All other beasts that saw, with like desire</l>
                    <l>Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.</l>
                    <l>Amid the tree now got, where plenty hung</l>
                    <l>Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill</l>
                    <l>I spared not; for, such pleasure till that hour,</l>
                    <l>At feed or fountain, never had I found.</l>
                    <l>Sated at length, ere long I might perceive</l>
                    <l>Strange alteration in me, to degree</l>
                    <l>Of reason in my inward powers; and speech</l>
                    <l>Wanted not long; though to this shape retained.</l>
                    <l>Thenceforth to speculations high or deep</l>
                    <l>I turned my thoughts, and with capacious mind</l>
                    <l>Considered all things visible in Heaven,</l>
                    <l>Or Earth, or Middle; all things fair and good:</l>
                    <l>But all that fair and good in thy divine</l>
                    <l>Semblance, and in thy beauty’s heavenly ray,</l>
                    <l>United I beheld; no fair to thine</l>
                    <l>Equivalent or second! which compelled</l>
                    <l>Me thus, though importune perhaps, to come</l>
                    <l>And gaze, and worship thee of right declared</l>
                    <l>Sovran of creatures, universal Dame!</l>
                    <l>So talked the spirited sly Snake; and Eve,</l>
                    <l>Yet more amazed, unwary thus replied.</l>
                    <l>Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt</l>
                    <l>The virtue of that fruit, in thee first proved:</l>
                    <l>But say, where grows the tree? from hence how far?</l>
                    <l>For many are the trees of God that grow</l>
                    <l>In Paradise, and various, yet unknown</l>
                    <l>To us; in such abundance lies our choice,</l>
                    <l>As leaves a greater store of fruit untouched,</l>
                    <l>Still hanging incorruptible, till men</l>
                    <l>Grow up to their provision, and more hands</l>
                    <l>Help to disburden Nature of her birth.</l>
                    <l>To whom the wily Adder, blithe and glad.</l>
                    <l>Empress, the way is ready, and not long;</l>
                    <l>Beyond a row of myrtles, on a flat,</l>
                    <l>Fast by a fountain, one small thicket past</l>
                    <l>Of blowing myrrh and balm: if thou accept</l>
                    <l>My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon</l>
                    <l>Lead then, said Eve. He, leading, swiftly rolled</l>
                    <l>In tangles, and made intricate seem straight,</l>
                    <l>To mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joy</l>
                    <l>Brightens his crest; as when a wandering fire,</l>
                    <l>Compact of unctuous vapour, which the night</l>
                    <l>Condenses, and the cold environs round,</l>
                    <l>Kindled through agitation to a flame,</l>
                    <l>Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends,</l>
                    <l>Hovering and blazing with delusive light,</l>
                    <l>Misleads the amazed night-wanderer from his way</l>
                    <l>To bogs and mires, and oft through pond or pool;</l>
                    <l>There swallowed up and lost, from succour far.</l>
                    <l>So glistered the dire Snake, and into fraud</l>
                    <l>Led Eve, our credulous mother, to the tree</l>
                    <l>Of prohibition, root of all our woe;</l>
                    <l>Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.</l>
                    <l>Serpent, we might have spared our coming hither,</l>
                    <l>Fruitless to me, though fruit be here to excess,</l>
                    <l>The credit of whose virtue rest with thee;</l>
                    <l>Wonderous indeed, if cause of such effects.</l>
                    <l>But of this tree we may not taste nor touch;</l>
                    <l>God so commanded, and left that command</l>
                    <l>Sole daughter of his voice; the rest, we live</l>
                    <l>Law to ourselves; our reason is our law.</l>
                    <l>To whom the Tempter guilefully replied.</l>
                    <l>Indeed! hath God then said that of the fruit</l>
                    <l>Of all these garden-trees ye shall not eat,</l>
                    <l>Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air?</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Eve, yet sinless. Of the fruit</l>
                    <l>Of each tree in the garden we may eat;</l>
                    <l>But of the fruit of this fair tree amidst</l>
                    <l>The garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat</l>
                    <l>Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die.</l>
                    <l>She scarce had said, though brief, when now more bold</l>
                    <l>The Tempter, but with show of zeal and love</l>
                    <l>To Man, and indignation at his wrong,</l>
                    <l>New part puts on; and, as to passion moved,</l>
                    <l>Fluctuates disturbed, yet comely and in act</l>
                    <l>Raised, as of some great matter to begin.</l>
                    <l>As when of old some orator renowned,</l>
                    <l>In Athens or free Rome, where eloquence</l>
                    <l>Flourished, since mute! to some great cause addressed,</l>
                    <l>Stood in himself collected; while each part,</l>
                    <l>Motion, each act, won audience ere the tongue;</l>
                    <l>Sometimes in highth began, as no delay</l>
                    <l>Of preface brooking, through his zeal of right:</l>
                    <l>So standing, moving, or to highth up grown,</l>
                    <l>The Tempter, all impassioned, thus began.</l>
                    <l>O sacred, wise, and wisdom-giving Plant,</l>
                    <l>Mother of science! now I feel thy power</l>
                    <l>Within me clear; not only to discern</l>
                    <l>Things in their causes, but to trace the ways</l>
                    <l>Of highest agents, deemed however wise.</l>
                    <l>Queen of this universe! do not believe</l>
                    <l>Those rigid threats of death: ye shall not die:</l>
                    <l>How should you? by the fruit? it gives you life</l>
                    <l>To knowledge; by the threatener? look on me,</l>
                    <l>Me, who have touched and tasted; yet both live,</l>
                    <l>And life more perfect have attained than Fate</l>
                    <l>Meant me, by venturing higher than my lot.</l>
                    <l>Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast</l>
                    <l>Is open? or will God incense his ire</l>
                    <l>For such a petty trespass? and not praise</l>
                    <l>Rather your dauntless virtue, whom the pain</l>
                    <l>Of death denounced, whatever thing death be,</l>
                    <l>Deterred not from achieving what might lead</l>
                    <l>To happier life, knowledge of good and evil;</l>
                    <l>Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil</l>
                    <l>Be real, why not known, since easier shunned?</l>
                    <l>God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;</l>
                    <l>Not just, not God; not feared then, nor obeyed:</l>
                    <l>Your fear itself of death removes the fear.</l>
                    <l>Why then was this forbid? Why, but to awe;</l>
                    <l>Why, but to keep ye low and ignorant,</l>
                    <l>His worshippers? He knows that in the day</l>
                    <l>Ye eat thereof, your eyes that seem so clear,</l>
                    <l>Yet are but dim, shall perfectly be then</l>
                    <l>Opened and cleared, and ye shall be as Gods,</l>
                    <l>Knowing both good and evil, as they know.</l>
                    <l>That ye shall be as Gods, since I as Man,</l>
                    <l>Internal Man, is but proportion meet;</l>
                    <l>I, of brute, human; ye, of human, Gods.</l>
                    <l>So ye shall die perhaps, by putting off</l>
                    <l>Human, to put on Gods; death to be wished,</l>
                    <l>Though threatened, which no worse than this can bring.</l>
                    <l>And what are Gods, that Man may not become</l>
                    <l>As they, participating God-like food?</l>
                    <l>The Gods are first, and that advantage use</l>
                    <l>On our belief, that all from them proceeds:</l>
                    <l>I question it; for this fair earth I see,</l>
                    <l>Warmed by the sun, producing every kind;</l>
                    <l>Them, nothing: if they all things, who enclosed</l>
                    <l>Knowledge of good and evil in this tree,</l>
                    <l>That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains</l>
                    <l>Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies</l>
                    <l>The offence, that Man should thus attain to know?</l>
                    <l>What can your knowledge hurt him, or this tree</l>
                    <l>Impart against his will, if all be his?</l>
                    <l>Or is it envy? and can envy dwell</l>
                    <l>In heavenly breasts? These, these, and many more</l>
                    <l>Causes import your need of this fair fruit.</l>
                    <l>Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste!</l>
                    <l>He ended; and his words, replete with guile,</l>
                    <l>Into her heart too easy entrance won:</l>
                    <l>Fixed on the fruit she gazed, which to behold</l>
                    <l>Might tempt alone; and in her ears the sound</l>
                    <l>Yet rung of his persuasive words, impregned</l>
                    <l>With reason, to her seeming, and with truth:</l>
                    <l>Mean while the hour of noon drew on, and waked</l>
                    <l>An eager appetite, raised by the smell</l>
                    <l>So savoury of that fruit, which with desire,</l>
                    <l>Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,</l>
                    <l>Solicited her longing eye; yet first</l>
                    <l>Pausing a while, thus to herself she mused.</l>
                    <l>Great are thy virtues, doubtless, best of fruits,</l>
                    <l>Though kept from man, and worthy to be admired;</l>
                    <l>Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay</l>
                    <l>Gave elocution to the mute, and taught</l>
                    <l>The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise:</l>
                    <l>Thy praise he also, who forbids thy use,</l>
                    <l>Conceals not from us, naming thee the tree</l>
                    <l>Of knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;</l>
                    <l>Forbids us then to taste! but his forbidding</l>
                    <l>Commends thee more, while it infers the good</l>
                    <l>By thee communicated, and our want:</l>
                    <l>For good unknown sure is not had; or, had</l>
                    <l>And yet unknown, is as not had at all.</l>
                    <l>In plain then, what forbids he but to know,</l>
                    <l>Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?</l>
                    <l>Such prohibitions bind not. But, if death</l>
                    <l>Bind us with after-bands, what profits then</l>
                    <l>Our inward freedom? In the day we eat</l>
                    <l>Of this fair fruit, our doom is, we shall die!</l>
                    <l>How dies the Serpent? he hath eaten and lives,</l>
                    <l>And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns,</l>
                    <l>Irrational till then. For us alone</l>
                    <l>Was death invented? or to us denied</l>
                    <l>This intellectual food, for beasts reserved?</l>
                    <l>For beasts it seems: yet that one beast which first</l>
                    <l>Hath tasted envies not, but brings with joy</l>
                    <l>The good befallen him, author unsuspect,</l>
                    <l>Friendly to man, far from deceit or guile.</l>
                    <l>What fear I then? rather, what know to fear</l>
                    <l>Under this ignorance of good and evil,</l>
                    <l>Of God or death, of law or penalty?</l>
                    <l>Here grows the cure of all, this fruit divine,</l>
                    <l>Fair to the eye, inviting to the taste,</l>
                    <l>Of virtue to make wise: What hinders then</l>
                    <l>To reach, and feed at once both body and mind?</l>
                    <l>So saying, her rash hand in evil hour</l>
                    <l>Forth reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat!</l>
                    <l>Earth felt the wound; and Nature from her seat,</l>
                    <l>Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe,</l>
                    <l>That all was lost. Back to the thicket slunk</l>
                    <l>The guilty Serpent; and well might; for Eve,</l>
                    <l>Intent now wholly on her taste, nought else</l>
                    <l>Regarded; such delight till then, as seemed,</l>
                    <l>In fruit she never tasted, whether true</l>
                    <l>Or fancied so, through expectation high</l>
                    <l>Of knowledge; not was Godhead from her thought.</l>
                    <l>Greedily she ingorged without restraint,</l>
                    <l>And knew not eating death: Satiate at length,</l>
                    <l>And hightened as with wine, jocund and boon,</l>
                    <l>Thus to herself she pleasingly began.</l>
                    <l>O sovran, virtuous, precious of all trees</l>
                    <l>In Paradise! of operation blest</l>
                    <l>To sapience, hitherto obscured, infamed.</l>
                    <l>And thy fair fruit let hang, as to no end</l>
                    <l>Created; but henceforth my early care,</l>
                    <l>Not without song, each morning, and due praise,</l>
                    <l>Shall tend thee, and the fertile burden ease</l>
                    <l>Of thy full branches offered free to all;</l>
                    <l>Till, dieted by thee, I grow mature</l>
                    <l>In knowledge, as the Gods, who all things know;</l>
                    <l>Though others envy what they cannot give:</l>
                    <l>For, had the gift been theirs, it had not here</l>
                    <l>Thus grown. Experience, next, to thee I owe,</l>
                    <l>Best guide; not following thee, I had remained</l>
                    <l>In ignorance; thou openest wisdom’s way,</l>
                    <l>And givest access, though secret she retire.</l>
                    <l>And I perhaps am secret: Heaven is high,</l>
                    <l>High, and remote to see from thence distinct</l>
                    <l>Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps</l>
                    <l>May have diverted from continual watch</l>
                    <l>Our great Forbidder, safe with all his spies</l>
                    <l>About him. But to Adam in what sort</l>
                    <l>Shall I appear? shall I to him make known</l>
                    <l>As yet my change, and give him to partake</l>
                    <l>Full happiness with me, or rather not,</l>
                    <l>But keeps the odds of knowledge in my power</l>
                    <l>Without copartner? so to add what wants</l>
                    <l>In female sex, the more to draw his love,</l>
                    <l>And render me more equal; and perhaps,</l>
                    <l>A thing not undesirable, sometime</l>
                    <l>Superiour; for, inferiour, who is free</l>
                    <l>This may be well: But what if God have seen,</l>
                    <l>And death ensue? then I shall be no more!</l>
                    <l>And Adam, wedded to another Eve,</l>
                    <l>Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;</l>
                    <l>A death to think! Confirmed then I resolve,</l>
                    <l>Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe:</l>
                    <l>So dear I love him, that with him all deaths</l>
                    <l>I could endure, without him live no life.</l>
                    <l>So saying, from the tree her step she turned;</l>
                    <l>But first low reverence done, as to the Power</l>
                    <l>That dwelt within, whose presence had infused</l>
                    <l>Into the plant sciential sap, derived</l>
                    <l>From nectar, drink of Gods. Adam the while,</l>
                    <l>Waiting desirous her return, had wove</l>
                    <l>Of choicest flowers a garland, to adorn</l>
                    <l>Her tresses, and her rural labours crown;</l>
                    <l>As reapers oft are wont their harvest-queen.</l>
                    <l>Great joy he promised to his thoughts, and new</l>
                    <l>Solace in her return, so long delayed:</l>
                    <l>Yet oft his heart, divine of something ill,</l>
                    <l>Misgave him; he the faltering measure felt;</l>
                    <l>And forth to meet her went, the way she took</l>
                    <l>That morn when first they parted: by the tree</l>
                    <l>Of knowledge he must pass; there he her met,</l>
                    <l>Scarce from the tree returning; in her hand</l>
                    <l>A bough of fairest fruit, that downy smiled,</l>
                    <l>New gathered, and ambrosial smell diffused.</l>
                    <l>To him she hasted; in her face excuse</l>
                    <l>Came prologue, and apology too prompt;</l>
                    <l>Which, with bland words at will, she thus addressed.</l>
                    <l>Hast thou not wondered, Adam, at my stay?</l>
                    <l>Thee I have missed, and thought it long, deprived</l>
                    <l>Thy presence; agony of love till now</l>
                    <l>Not felt, nor shall be twice; for never more</l>
                    <l>Mean I to try, what rash untried I sought,</l>
                    <l>The pain of absence from thy sight. But strange</l>
                    <l>Hath been the cause, and wonderful to hear:</l>
                    <l>This tree is not, as we are told, a tree</l>
                    <l>Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown</l>
                    <l>Opening the way, but of divine effect</l>
                    <l>To open eyes, and make them Gods who taste;</l>
                    <l>And hath been tasted such: The serpent wise,</l>
                    <l>Or not restrained as we, or not obeying,</l>
                    <l>Hath eaten of the fruit; and is become,</l>
                    <l>Not dead, as we are threatened, but thenceforth</l>
                    <l>Endued with human voice and human sense,</l>
                    <l>Reasoning to admiration; and with me</l>
                    <l>Persuasively hath so prevailed, that I</l>
                    <l>Have also tasted, and have also found</l>
                    <l>The effects to correspond; opener mine eyes,</l>
                    <l>Dim erst, dilated spirits, ampler heart,</l>
                    <l>And growing up to Godhead; which for thee</l>
                    <l>Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.</l>
                    <l>For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss;</l>
                    <l>Tedious, unshared with thee, and odious soon.</l>
                    <l>Thou therefore also taste, that equal lot</l>
                    <l>May join us, equal joy, as equal love;</l>
                    <l>Lest, thou not tasting, different degree</l>
                    <l>Disjoin us, and I then too late renounce</l>
                    <l>Deity for thee, when Fate will not permit.</l>
                    <l>Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told;</l>
                    <l>But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed.</l>
                    <l>On the other side Adam, soon as he heard</l>
                    <l>The fatal trespass done by Eve, amazed,</l>
                    <l>Astonied stood and blank, while horrour chill</l>
                    <l>Ran through his veins, and all his joints relaxed;</l>
                    <l>From his slack hand the garland wreathed for Eve</l>
                    <l>Down dropt, and all the faded roses shed:</l>
                    <l>Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length</l>
                    <l>First to himself he inward silence broke.</l>
                    <l>O fairest of Creation, last and best</l>
                    <l>Of all God’s works, Creature in whom excelled</l>
                    <l>Whatever can to sight or thought be formed,</l>
                    <l>Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!</l>
                    <l>How art thou lost! how on a sudden lost,</l>
                    <l>Defaced, deflowered, and now to death devote!</l>
                    <l>Rather, how hast thou yielded to transgress</l>
                    <l>The strict forbiddance, how to violate</l>
                    <l>The sacred fruit forbidden! Some cursed fraud</l>
                    <l>Of enemy hath beguiled thee, yet unknown,</l>
                    <l>And me with thee hath ruined; for with thee</l>
                    <l>Certain my resolution is to die:</l>
                    <l>How can I live without thee! how forego</l>
                    <l>Thy sweet converse, and love so dearly joined,</l>
                    <l>To live again in these wild woods forlorn!</l>
                    <l>Should God create another Eve, and I</l>
                    <l>Another rib afford, yet loss of thee</l>
                    <l>Would never from my heart: no, no! I feel</l>
                    <l>The link of Nature draw me: flesh of flesh,</l>
                    <l>Bone of my bone thou art, and from thy state</l>
                    <l>Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.</l>
                    <l>So having said, as one from sad dismay</l>
                    <l>Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbed</l>
                    <l>Submitting to what seemed remediless,</l>
                    <l>Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned.</l>
                    <l>Bold deed thou hast presumed, adventurous Eve,</l>
                    <l>And peril great provoked, who thus hast dared,</l>
                    <l>Had it been only coveting to eye</l>
                    <l>That sacred fruit, sacred to abstinence,</l>
                    <l>Much more to taste it under ban to touch.</l>
                    <l>But past who can recall, or done undo?</l>
                    <l>Not God Omnipotent, nor Fate; yet so</l>
                    <l>Perhaps thou shalt not die, perhaps the fact</l>
                    <l>Is not so heinous now, foretasted fruit,</l>
                    <l>Profaned first by the serpent, by him first</l>
                    <l>Made common, and unhallowed, ere our taste;</l>
                    <l>Nor yet on him found deadly; yet he lives;</l>
                    <l>Lives, as thou saidst, and gains to live, as Man,</l>
                    <l>Higher degree of life; inducement strong</l>
                    <l>To us, as likely tasting to attain</l>
                    <l>Proportional ascent; which cannot be</l>
                    <l>But to be Gods, or Angels, demi-Gods.</l>
                    <l>Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,</l>
                    <l>Though threatening, will in earnest so destroy</l>
                    <l>Us his prime creatures, dignified so high,</l>
                    <l>Set over all his works; which in our fall,</l>
                    <l>For us created, needs with us must fail,</l>
                    <l>Dependant made; so God shall uncreate,</l>
                    <l>Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour lose;</l>
                    <l>Not well conceived of God, who, though his power</l>
                    <l>Creation could repeat, yet would be loth</l>
                    <l>Us to abolish, lest the Adversary</l>
                    <l>Triumph, and say; “Fickle their state whom God</l>
                    <l>Most favours; who can please him long? Me first</l>
                    <l>He ruined, now Mankind; whom will he next?”</l>
                    <l>Matter of scorn, not to be given the Foe.</l>
                    <l>However I with thee have fixed my lot,</l>
                    <l>Certain to undergo like doom: If death</l>
                    <l>Consort with thee, death is to me as life;</l>
                    <l>So forcible within my heart I feel</l>
                    <l>The bond of Nature draw me to my own;</l>
                    <l>My own in thee, for what thou art is mine;</l>
                    <l>Our state cannot be severed; we are one,</l>
                    <l>One flesh; to lose thee were to lose myself.</l>
                    <l>So Adam; and thus Eve to him replied.</l>
                    <l>O glorious trial of exceeding love,</l>
                    <l>Illustrious evidence, example high!</l>
                    <l>Engaging me to emulate; but, short</l>
                    <l>Of thy perfection, how shall I attain,</l>
                    <l>Adam, from whose dear side I boast me sprung,</l>
                    <l>And gladly of our union hear thee speak,</l>
                    <l>One heart, one soul in both; whereof good proof</l>
                    <l>This day affords, declaring thee resolved,</l>
                    <l>Rather than death, or aught than death more dread,</l>
                    <l>Shall separate us, linked in love so dear,</l>
                    <l>To undergo with me one guilt, one crime,</l>
                    <l>If any be, of tasting this fair fruit;</l>
                    <l>Whose virtue for of good still good proceeds,</l>
                    <l>Direct, or by occasion, hath presented</l>
                    <l>This happy trial of thy love, which else</l>
                    <l>So eminently never had been known?</l>
                    <l>Were it I thought death menaced would ensue</l>
                    <l>This my attempt, I would sustain alone</l>
                    <l>The worst, and not persuade thee, rather die</l>
                    <l>Deserted, than oblige thee with a fact</l>
                    <l>Pernicious to thy peace; chiefly assured</l>
                    <l>Remarkably so late of thy so true,</l>
                    <l>So faithful, love unequalled: but I feel</l>
                    <l>Far otherwise the event; not death, but life</l>
                    <l>Augmented, opened eyes, new hopes, new joys,</l>
                    <l>Taste so divine, that what of sweet before</l>
                    <l>Hath touched my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.</l>
                    <l>On my experience, Adam, freely taste,</l>
                    <l>And fear of death deliver to the winds.</l>
                    <l>So saying, she embraced him, and for joy</l>
                    <l>Tenderly wept; much won, that he his love</l>
                    <l>Had so ennobled, as of choice to incur</l>
                    <l>Divine displeasure for her sake, or death.</l>
                    <l>In recompence (for such compliance bad</l>
                    <l>Such recompence best merits) from the bough</l>
                    <l>She gave him of that fair enticing fruit</l>
                    <l>With liberal hand: he scrupled not to eat,</l>
                    <l>Against his better knowledge; not deceived,</l>
                    <l>But fondly overcome with female charm.</l>
                    <l>Earth trembled from her entrails, as again</l>
                    <l>In pangs; and Nature gave a second groan;</l>
                    <l>Sky loured; and, muttering thunder, some sad drops</l>
                    <l>Wept at completing of the mortal sin</l>
                    <l>Original: while Adam took no thought,</l>
                    <l>Eating his fill; nor Eve to iterate</l>
                    <l>Her former trespass feared, the more to sooth</l>
                    <l>Him with her loved society; that now,</l>
                    <l>As with new wine intoxicated both,</l>
                    <l>They swim in mirth, and fancy that they feel</l>
                    <l>Divinity within them breeding wings,</l>
                    <l>Wherewith to scorn the earth: But that false fruit</l>
                    <l>Far other operation first displayed,</l>
                    <l>Carnal desire inflaming; he on Eve</l>
                    <l>Began to cast lascivious eyes; she him</l>
                    <l>As wantonly repaid; in lust they burn:</l>
                    <l>Till Adam thus ’gan Eve to dalliance move.</l>
                    <l>Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste,</l>
                    <l>And elegant, of sapience no small part;</l>
                    <l>Since to each meaning savour we apply,</l>
                    <l>And palate call judicious; I the praise</l>
                    <l>Yield thee, so well this day thou hast purveyed.</l>
                    <l>Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstained</l>
                    <l>From this delightful fruit, nor known till now</l>
                    <l>True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be</l>
                    <l>In things to us forbidden, it might be wished,</l>
                    <l>For this one tree had been forbidden ten.</l>
                    <l>But come, so well refreshed, now let us play,</l>
                    <l>As meet is, after such delicious fare;</l>
                    <l>For never did thy beauty, since the day</l>
                    <l>I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorned</l>
                    <l>With all perfections, so inflame my sense</l>
                    <l>With ardour to enjoy thee, fairer now</l>
                    <l>Than ever; bounty of this virtuous tree!</l>
                    <l>So said he, and forbore not glance or toy</l>
                    <l>Of amorous intent; well understood</l>
                    <l>Of Eve, whose eye darted contagious fire.</l>
                    <l>Her hand he seised; and to a shady bank,</l>
                    <l>Thick over-head with verdant roof imbowered,</l>
                    <l>He led her nothing loth; flowers were the couch,</l>
                    <l>Pansies, and violets, and asphodel,</l>
                    <l>And hyacinth; Earth’s freshest softest lap.</l>
                    <l>There they their fill of love and love’s disport</l>
                    <l>Took largely, of their mutual guilt the seal,</l>
                    <l>The solace of their sin; till dewy sleep</l>
                    <l>Oppressed them, wearied with their amorous play,</l>
                    <l>Soon as the force of that fallacious fruit,</l>
                    <l>That with exhilarating vapour bland</l>
                    <l>About their spirits had played, and inmost powers</l>
                    <l>Made err, was now exhaled; and grosser sleep,</l>
                    <l>Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams</l>
                    <l>Incumbered, now had left them; up they rose</l>
                    <l>As from unrest; and, each the other viewing,</l>
                    <l>Soon found their eyes how opened, and their minds</l>
                    <l>How darkened; innocence, that as a veil</l>
                    <l>Had shadowed them from knowing ill, was gone;</l>
                    <l>Just confidence, and native righteousness,</l>
                    <l>And honour, from about them, naked left</l>
                    <l>To guilty Shame; he covered, but his robe</l>
                    <l>Uncovered more. So rose the Danite strong,</l>
                    <l>Herculean Samson, from the harlot-lap</l>
                    <l>Of Philistean Dalilah, and waked</l>
                    <l>Shorn of his strength. They destitute and bare</l>
                    <l>Of all their virtue: Silent, and in face</l>
                    <l>Confounded, long they sat, as strucken mute:</l>
                    <l>Till Adam, though not less than Eve abashed,</l>
                    <l>At length gave utterance to these words constrained.</l>
                    <l>O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give ear</l>
                    <l>To that false worm, of whomsoever taught</l>
                    <l>To counterfeit Man’s voice; true in our fall,</l>
                    <l>False in our promised rising; since our eyes</l>
                    <l>Opened we find indeed, and find we know</l>
                    <l>Both good and evil; good lost, and evil got;</l>
                    <l>Bad fruit of knowledge, if this be to know;</l>
                    <l>Which leaves us naked thus, of honour void,</l>
                    <l>Of innocence, of faith, of purity,</l>
                    <l>Our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained,</l>
                    <l>And in our faces evident the signs</l>
                    <l>Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store;</l>
                    <l>Even shame, the last of evils; of the first</l>
                    <l>Be sure then.—How shall I behold the face</l>
                    <l>Henceforth of God or Angel, erst with joy</l>
                    <l>And rapture so oft beheld? Those heavenly shapes</l>
                    <l>Will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze</l>
                    <l>Insufferably bright. O! might I here</l>
                    <l>In solitude live savage; in some glade</l>
                    <l>Obscured, where highest woods, impenetrable</l>
                    <l>To star or sun-light, spread their umbrage broad</l>
                    <l>And brown as evening: Cover me, ye Pines!</l>
                    <l>Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs</l>
                    <l>Hide me, where I may never see them more!—</l>
                    <l>But let us now, as in bad plight, devise</l>
                    <l>What best may for the present serve to hide</l>
                    <l>The parts of each from other, that seem most</l>
                    <l>To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen;</l>
                    <l>Some tree, whose broad smooth leaves together sewed,</l>
                    <l>And girded on our loins, may cover round</l>
                    <l>Those middle parts; that this new comer, Shame,</l>
                    <l>There sit not, and reproach us as unclean.</l>
                    <l>So counselled he, and both together went</l>
                    <l>Into the thickest wood; there soon they chose</l>
                    <l>The fig-tree; not that kind for fruit renowned,</l>
                    <l>But such as at this day, to Indians known,</l>
                    <l>In Malabar or Decan spreads her arms</l>
                    <l>Branching so broad and long, that in the ground</l>
                    <l>The bended twigs take root, and daughters grow</l>
                    <l>About the mother tree, a pillared shade</l>
                    <l>High over-arched, and echoing walks between:</l>
                    <l>There oft the Indian herdsman, shunning heat,</l>
                    <l>Shelters in cool, and tends his pasturing herds</l>
                    <l>At loop-holes cut through thickest shade: Those leaves</l>
                    <l>They gathered, broad as Amazonian targe;</l>
                    <l>And, with what skill they had, together sewed,</l>
                    <l>To gird their waist; vain covering, if to hide</l>
                    <l>Their guilt and dreaded shame! O, how unlike</l>
                    <l>To that first naked glory! Such of late</l>
                    <l>Columbus found the American, so girt</l>
                    <l>With feathered cincture; naked else, and wild</l>
                    <l>Among the trees on isles and woody shores.</l>
                    <l>Thus fenced, and, as they thought, their shame in part</l>
                    <l>Covered, but not at rest or ease of mind,</l>
                    <l>They sat them down to weep; nor only tears</l>
                    <l>Rained at their eyes, but high winds worse within</l>
                    <l>Began to rise, high passions, anger, hate,</l>
                    <l>Mistrust, suspicion, discord; and shook sore</l>
                    <l>Their inward state of mind, calm region once</l>
                    <l>And full of peace, now tost and turbulent:</l>
                    <l>For Understanding ruled not, and the Will</l>
                    <l>Heard not her lore; both in subjection now</l>
                    <l>To sensual Appetite, who from beneath</l>
                    <l>Usurping over sovran Reason claimed</l>
                    <l>Superiour sway: From thus distempered breast,</l>
                    <l>Adam, estranged in look and altered style,</l>
                    <l>Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed.</l>
                    <l>Would thou hadst hearkened to my words, and staid</l>
                    <l>With me, as I besought thee, when that strange</l>
                    <l>Desire of wandering, this unhappy morn,</l>
                    <l>I know not whence possessed thee; we had then</l>
                    <l>Remained still happy; not, as now, despoiled</l>
                    <l>Of all our good; shamed, naked, miserable!</l>
                    <l>Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve</l>
                    <l>The faith they owe; when earnestly they seek</l>
                    <l>Such proof, conclude, they then begin to fail.</l>
                    <l>To whom, soon moved with touch of blame, thus Eve.</l>
                    <l>What words have passed thy lips, Adam severe!</l>
                    <l>Imputest thou that to my default, or will</l>
                    <l>Of wandering, as thou callest it, which who knows</l>
                    <l>But might as ill have happened thou being by,</l>
                    <l>Or to thyself perhaps? Hadst thou been there,</l>
                    <l>Or here the attempt, thou couldst not have discerned</l>
                    <l>Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;</l>
                    <l>No ground of enmity between us known,</l>
                    <l>Why he should mean me ill, or seek to harm.</l>
                    <l>Was I to have never parted from thy side?</l>
                    <l>As good have grown there still a lifeless rib.</l>
                    <l>Being as I am, why didst not thou, the head,</l>
                    <l>Command me absolutely not to go,</l>
                    <l>Going into such danger, as thou saidst?</l>
                    <l>Too facile then, thou didst not much gainsay;</l>
                    <l>Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.</l>
                    <l>Hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent,</l>
                    <l>Neither had I transgressed, nor thou with me.</l>
                    <l>To whom, then first incensed, Adam replied.</l>
                    <l>Is this the love, is this the recompence</l>
                    <l>Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve! expressed</l>
                    <l>Immutable, when thou wert lost, not I;</l>
                    <l>Who might have lived, and joyed immortal bliss,</l>
                    <l>Yet willingly chose rather death with thee?</l>
                    <l>And am I now upbraided as the cause</l>
                    <l>Of thy transgressing? Not enough severe,</l>
                    <l>It seems, in thy restraint: What could I more</l>
                    <l>I warned thee, I admonished thee, foretold</l>
                    <l>The danger, and the lurking enemy</l>
                    <l>That lay in wait; beyond this, had been force;</l>
                    <l>And force upon free will hath here no place.</l>
                    <l>But confidence then bore thee on; secure</l>
                    <l>Either to meet no danger, or to find</l>
                    <l>Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps</l>
                    <l>I also erred, in overmuch admiring</l>
                    <l>What seemed in thee so perfect, that I thought</l>
                    <l>No evil durst attempt thee; but I rue</l>
                    <l>The errour now, which is become my crime,</l>
                    <l>And thou the accuser. Thus it shall befall</l>
                    <l>Him, who, to worth in women overtrusting,</l>
                    <l>Lets her will rule: restraint she will not brook;</l>
                    <l>And, left to herself, if evil thence ensue,</l>
                    <l>She first his weak indulgence will accuse.</l>
                    <l>Thus they in mutual accusation spent</l>
                    <l>The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning;</l>
                    <l>And of their vain contest appeared no end.</l>

                    <l>Mean while the heinous and despiteful act</l>
                    <l>Of Satan, done in Paradise; and how</l>
                    <l>He, in the serpent, had perverted Eve,</l>
                    <l>Her husband she, to taste the fatal fruit,</l>
                    <l>Was known in Heaven; for what can ’scape the eye</l>
                    <l>Of God all-seeing, or deceive his heart</l>
                    <l>Omniscient? who, in all things wise and just,</l>
                    <l>Hindered not Satan to attempt the mind</l>
                    <l>Of Man, with strength entire and free will armed,</l>
                    <l>Complete to have discovered and repulsed</l>
                    <l>Whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend.</l>
                    <l>For still they knew, and ought to have still remembered,</l>
                    <l>The high injunction, not to taste that fruit,</l>
                    <l>Whoever tempted; which they not obeying,</l>
                    <l>(Incurred what could they less?) the penalty;</l>
                    <l>And, manifold in sin, deserved to fall.</l>
                    <l>Up into Heaven from Paradise in haste</l>
                    <l>The angelick guards ascended, mute, and sad,</l>
                    <l>For Man; for of his state by this they knew,</l>
                    <l>Much wondering how the subtle Fiend had stolen</l>
                    <l>Entrance unseen. Soon as the unwelcome news</l>
                    <l>From Earth arrived at Heaven-gate, displeased</l>
                    <l>All were who heard; dim sadness did not spare</l>
                    <l>That time celestial visages, yet, mixed</l>
                    <l>With pity, violated not their bliss.</l>
                    <l>About the new-arrived, in multitudes</l>
                    <l>The ethereal people ran, to hear and know</l>
                    <l>How all befel: They towards the throne supreme,</l>
                    <l>Accountable, made haste, to make appear,</l>
                    <l>With righteous plea, their utmost vigilance</l>
                    <l>And easily approved; when the Most High</l>
                    <l>Eternal Father, from his secret cloud,</l>
                    <l>Amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice.</l>
                    <l>Assembled Angels, and ye Powers returned</l>
                    <l>From unsuccessful charge; be not dismayed,</l>
                    <l>Nor troubled at these tidings from the earth,</l>
                    <l>Which your sincerest care could not prevent;</l>
                    <l>Foretold so lately what would come to pass,</l>
                    <l>When first this tempter crossed the gulf from Hell.</l>
                    <l>I told ye then he should prevail, and speed</l>
                    <l>On his bad errand; Man should be seduced,</l>
                    <l>And flattered out of all, believing lies</l>
                    <l>Against his Maker; no decree of mine</l>
                    <l>Concurring to necessitate his fall,</l>
                    <l>Or touch with lightest moment of impulse</l>
                    <l>His free will, to her own inclining left</l>
                    <l>In even scale. But fallen he is; and now</l>
                    <l>What rests, but that the mortal sentence pass</l>
                    <l>On his transgression,—death denounced that day?</l>
                    <l>Which he presumes already vain and void,</l>
                    <l>Because not yet inflicted, as he feared,</l>
                    <l>By some immediate stroke; but soon shall find</l>
                    <l>Forbearance no acquittance, ere day end.</l>
                    <l>Justice shall not return as bounty scorned.</l>
                    <l>But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee,</l>
                    <l>Vicegerent Son? To thee I have transferred</l>
                    <l>All judgement, whether in Heaven, or Earth, or Hell.</l>
                    <l>Easy it may be seen that I intend</l>
                    <l>Mercy colleague with justice, sending thee</l>
                    <l>Man’s friend, his Mediator, his designed</l>
                    <l>Both ransom and Redeemer voluntary,</l>
                    <l>And destined Man himself to judge Man fallen.</l>
                    <l>So spake the Father; and, unfolding bright</l>
                    <l>Toward the right hand his glory, on the Son</l>
                    <l>Blazed forth unclouded Deity: He full</l>
                    <l>Resplendent all his Father manifest</l>
                    <l>Expressed, and thus divinely answered mild.</l>
                    <l>Father Eternal, thine is to decree;</l>
                    <l>Mine, both in Heaven and Earth, to do thy will</l>
                    <l>Supreme; that thou in me, thy Son beloved,</l>
                    <l>Mayest ever rest well pleased. I go to judge</l>
                    <l>On earth these thy transgressours; but thou knowest,</l>
                    <l>Whoever judged, the worst on me must light,</l>
                    <l>When time shall be; for so I undertook</l>
                    <l>Before thee; and, not repenting, this obtain</l>
                    <l>Of right, that I may mitigate their doom</l>
                    <l>On me derived; yet I shall temper so</l>
                    <l>Justice with mercy, as may illustrate most</l>
                    <l>Them fully satisfied, and thee appease.</l>
                    <l>Attendance none shall need, nor train, where none</l>
                    <l>Are to behold the judgement, but the judged,</l>
                    <l>Those two; the third best absent is condemned,</l>
                    <l>Convict by flight, and rebel to all law:</l>
                    <l>Conviction to the serpent none belongs.</l>
                    <l>Thus saying, from his radiant seat he rose</l>
                    <l>Of high collateral glory: Him Thrones, and Powers,</l>
                    <l>Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant,</l>
                    <l>Accompanied to Heaven-gate; from whence</l>
                    <l>Eden, and all the coast, in prospect lay.</l>
                    <l>Down he descended straight; the speed of Gods</l>
                    <l>Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes winged.</l>
                    <l>Now was the sun in western cadence low</l>
                    <l>From noon, and gentle airs, due at their hour,</l>
                    <l>To fan the earth now waked, and usher in</l>
                    <l>The evening cool; when he, from wrath more cool,</l>
                    <l>Came the mild Judge, and Intercessour both,</l>
                    <l>To sentence Man: The voice of God they heard</l>
                    <l>Now walking in the garden, by soft winds</l>
                    <l>Brought to their ears, while day declined; they heard,</l>
                    <l>And from his presence hid themselves among</l>
                    <l>The thickest trees, both man and wife; till God,</l>
                    <l>Approaching, thus to Adam called aloud.</l>
                    <l>Where art thou, Adam, wont with joy to meet</l>
                    <l>My coming seen far off? I miss thee here,</l>
                    <l>Not pleased, thus entertained with solitude,</l>
                    <l>Where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought:</l>
                    <l>Or come I less conspicuous, or what change</l>
                    <l>Absents thee, or what chance detains?—Come forth!</l>
                    <l>He came; and with him Eve, more loth, though first</l>
                    <l>To offend; discountenanced both, and discomposed;</l>
                    <l>Love was not in their looks, either to God,</l>
                    <l>Or to each other; but apparent guilt,</l>
                    <l>And shame, and perturbation, and despair,</l>
                    <l>Anger, and obstinacy, and hate, and guile.</l>
                    <l>Whence Adam, faltering long, thus answered brief.</l>
                    <l>I heard thee in the garden, and of thy voice</l>
                    <l>Afraid, being naked, hid myself. To whom</l>
                    <l>The gracious Judge without revile replied.</l>
                    <l>My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not feared,</l>
                    <l>But still rejoiced; how is it now become</l>
                    <l>So dreadful to thee? That thou art naked, who</l>
                    <l>Hath told thee? Hast thou eaten of the tree,</l>
                    <l>Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Adam sore beset replied.</l>
                    <l>O Heaven! in evil strait this day I stand</l>
                    <l>Before my Judge; either to undergo</l>
                    <l>Myself the total crime, or to accuse</l>
                    <l>My other self, the partner of my life;</l>
                    <l>Whose failing, while her faith to me remains,</l>
                    <l>I should conceal, and not expose to blame</l>
                    <l>By my complaint: but strict necessity</l>
                    <l>Subdues me, and calamitous constraint;</l>
                    <l>Lest on my head both sin and punishment,</l>
                    <l>However insupportable, be all</l>
                    <l>Devolved; though should I hold my peace, yet thou</l>
                    <l>Wouldst easily detect what I conceal.—</l>
                    <l>This Woman, whom thou madest to be my help,</l>
                    <l>And gavest me as thy perfect gift, so good,</l>
                    <l>So fit, so acceptable, so divine,</l>
                    <l>That from her hand I could suspect no ill,</l>
                    <l>And what she did, whatever in itself,</l>
                    <l>Her doing seemed to justify the deed;</l>
                    <l>She gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</l>
                    <l>To whom the Sovran Presence thus replied.</l>
                    <l>Was she thy God, that her thou didst obey</l>
                    <l>Before his voice? or was she made thy guide,</l>
                    <l>Superiour, or but equal, that to her</l>
                    <l>Thou didst resign thy manhood, and the place</l>
                    <l>Wherein God set thee above her made of thee,</l>
                    <l>And for thee, whose perfection far excelled</l>
                    <l>Hers in all real dignity? Adorned</l>
                    <l>She was indeed, and lovely, to attract</l>
                    <l>Thy love, not thy subjection; and her gifts</l>
                    <l>Were such, as under government well seemed;</l>
                    <l>Unseemly to bear rule; which was thy part</l>
                    <l>And person, hadst thou known thyself aright.</l>
                    <l>So having said, he thus to Eve in few.</l>
                    <l>Say, Woman, what is this which thou hast done?</l>
                    <l>To whom sad Eve, with shame nigh overwhelmed,</l>
                    <l>Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge</l>
                    <l>Bold or loquacious, thus abashed replied.</l>
                    <l>The Serpent me beguiled, and I did eat.</l>
                    <l>Which when the Lord God heard, without delay</l>
                    <l>To judgement he proceeded on the accused</l>
                    <l>Serpent, though brute; unable to transfer</l>
                    <l>The guilt on him, who made him instrument</l>
                    <l>Of mischief, and polluted from the end</l>
                    <l>Of his creation; justly then accursed,</l>
                    <l>As vitiated in nature: More to know</l>
                    <l>Concerned not Man, (since he no further knew)</l>
                    <l>Nor altered his offence; yet God at last</l>
                    <l>To Satan first in sin his doom applied,</l>
                    <l>Though in mysterious terms, judged as then best:</l>
                    <l>And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall.</l>
                    <l>Because thou hast done this, thou art accursed</l>
                    <l>Above all cattle, each beast of the field;</l>
                    <l>Upon thy belly groveling thou shalt go,</l>
                    <l>And dust shalt eat all the days of thy life.</l>
                    <l>Between thee and the woman I will put</l>
                    <l>Enmity, and between thine and her seed;</l>
                    <l>Her seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel.</l>
                    <l>So spake this oracle, then verified</l>
                    <l>When Jesus, Son of Mary, second Eve,</l>
                    <l>Saw Satan fall, like lightning, down from Heaven,</l>
                    <l>Prince of the air; then, rising from his grave</l>
                    <l>Spoiled Principalities and Powers, triumphed</l>
                    <l>In open show; and, with ascension bright,</l>
                    <l>Captivity led captive through the air,</l>
                    <l>The realm itself of Satan, long usurped;</l>
                    <l>Whom he shall tread at last under our feet;</l>
                    <l>Even he, who now foretold his fatal bruise;</l>
                    <l>And to the Woman thus his sentence turned.</l>
                    <l>Thy sorrow I will greatly multiply</l>
                    <l>By thy conception; children thou shalt bring</l>
                    <l>In sorrow forth; and to thy husband’s will</l>
                    <l>Thine shall submit; he over thee shall rule.</l>
                    <l>On Adam last thus judgement he pronounced.</l>
                    <l>Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife,</l>
                    <l>And eaten of the tree, concerning which</l>
                    <l>I charged thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat thereof:</l>
                    <l>Cursed is the ground for thy sake; thou in sorrow</l>
                    <l>Shalt eat thereof, all the days of thy life;</l>
                    <l>Thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth</l>
                    <l>Unbid; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;</l>
                    <l>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,</l>
                    <l>Till thou return unto the ground; for thou</l>
                    <l>Out of the ground wast taken, know thy birth,</l>
                    <l>For dust thou art, and shalt to dust return.</l>
                    <l>So judged he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent;</l>
                    <l>And the instant stroke of death, denounced that day,</l>
                    <l>Removed far off; then, pitying how they stood</l>
                    <l>Before him naked to the air, that now</l>
                    <l>Must suffer change, disdained not to begin</l>
                    <l>Thenceforth the form of servant to assume;</l>
                    <l>As when he washed his servants feet; so now,</l>
                    <l>As father of his family, he clad</l>
                    <l>Their nakedness with skins of beasts, or slain,</l>
                    <l>Or as the snake with youthful coat repaid;</l>
                    <l>And thought not much to clothe his enemies;</l>
                    <l>Nor he their outward only with the skins</l>
                    <l>Of beasts, but inward nakedness, much more.</l>
                    <l>Opprobrious, with his robe of righteousness,</l>
                    <l>Arraying, covered from his Father’s sight.</l>
                    <l>To him with swift ascent he up returned,</l>
                    <l>Into his blissful bosom reassumed</l>
                    <l>In glory, as of old; to him appeased</l>
                    <l>All, though all-knowing, what had passed with Man</l>
                    <l>Recounted, mixing intercession sweet.</l>
                    <l>Mean while, ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth,</l>
                    <l>Within the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death,</l>
                    <l>In counterview within the gates, that now</l>
                    <l>Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame</l>
                    <l>Far into Chaos, since the Fiend passed through,</l>
                    <l>Sin opening; who thus now to Death began.</l>
                    <l>O Son, why sit we here each other viewing</l>
                    <l>Idly, while Satan, our great author, thrives</l>
                    <l>In other worlds, and happier seat provides</l>
                    <l>For us, his offspring dear? It cannot be</l>
                    <l>But that success attends him; if mishap,</l>
                    <l>Ere this he had returned, with fury driven</l>
                    <l>By his avengers; since no place like this</l>
                    <l>Can fit his punishment, or their revenge.</l>
                    <l>Methinks I feel new strength within me rise,</l>
                    <l>Wings growing, and dominion given me large</l>
                    <l>Beyond this deep; whatever draws me on,</l>
                    <l>Or sympathy, or some connatural force,</l>
                    <l>Powerful at greatest distance to unite,</l>
                    <l>With secret amity, things of like kind,</l>
                    <l>By secretest conveyance. Thou, my shade</l>
                    <l>Inseparable, must with me along;</l>
                    <l>For Death from Sin no power can separate.</l>
                    <l>But, lest the difficulty of passing back</l>
                    <l>Stay his return perhaps over this gulf</l>
                    <l>Impassable, impervious; let us try</l>
                    <l>Adventurous work, yet to thy power and mine</l>
                    <l>Not unagreeable, to found a path</l>
                    <l>Over this main from Hell to that new world,</l>
                    <l>Where Satan now prevails; a monument</l>
                    <l>Of merit high to all the infernal host,</l>
                    <l>Easing their passage hence, for intercourse,</l>
                    <l>Or transmigration, as their lot shall lead.</l>
                    <l>Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn</l>
                    <l>By this new-felt attraction and instinct.</l>
                    <l>Whom thus the meager Shadow answered soon.</l>
                    <l>Go, whither Fate, and inclination strong,</l>
                    <l>Leads thee; I shall not lag behind, nor err</l>
                    <l>The way, thou leading; such a scent I draw</l>
                    <l>Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste</l>
                    <l>The savour of death from all things there that live:</l>
                    <l>Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest</l>
                    <l>Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid.</l>
                    <l>So saying, with delight he snuffed the smell</l>
                    <l>Of mortal change on earth. As when a flock</l>
                    <l>Of ravenous fowl, though many a league remote,</l>
                    <l>Against the day of battle, to a field,</l>
                    <l>Where armies lie encamped, come flying, lured</l>
                    <l>With scent of living carcasses designed</l>
                    <l>For death, the following day, in bloody fight:</l>
                    <l>So scented the grim Feature, and upturned</l>
                    <l>His nostril wide into the murky air;</l>
                    <l>Sagacious of his quarry from so far.</l>
                    <l>Then both from out Hell-gates, into the waste</l>
                    <l>Wide anarchy of Chaos, damp and dark,</l>
                    <l>Flew diverse; and with power (their power was great)</l>
                    <l>Hovering upon the waters, what they met</l>
                    <l>Solid or slimy, as in raging sea</l>
                    <l>Tost up and down, together crouded drove,</l>
                    <l>From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell;</l>
                    <l>As when two polar winds, blowing adverse</l>
                    <l>Upon the Cronian sea, together drive</l>
                    <l>Mountains of ice, that stop the imagined way</l>
                    <l>Beyond Petsora eastward, to the rich</l>
                    <l>Cathaian coast. The aggregated soil</l>
                    <l>Death with his mace petrifick, cold and dry,</l>
                    <l>As with a trident, smote; and fixed as firm</l>
                    <l>As Delos, floating once; the rest his look</l>
                    <l>Bound with Gorgonian rigour not to move;</l>
                    <l>And with Asphaltick slime, broad as the gate,</l>
                    <l>Deep to the roots of Hell the gathered beach</l>
                    <l>They fastened, and the mole immense wrought on</l>
                    <l>Over the foaming deep high-arched, a bridge</l>
                    <l>Of length prodigious, joining to the wall</l>
                    <l>Immoveable of this now fenceless world,</l>
                    <l>Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad,</l>
                    <l>Smooth, easy, inoffensive, down to Hell.</l>
                    <l>So, if great things to small may be compared,</l>
                    <l>Xerxes, the liberty of Greece to yoke,</l>
                    <l>From Susa, his Memnonian palace high,</l>
                    <l>Came to the sea: and, over Hellespont</l>
                    <l>Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joined,</l>
                    <l>And scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves.</l>
                    <l>Now had they brought the work by wonderous art</l>
                    <l>Pontifical, a ridge of pendant rock,</l>
                    <l>Over the vexed abyss, following the track</l>
                    <l>Of Satan to the self-same place where he</l>
                    <l>First lighted from his wing, and landed safe</l>
                    <l>From out of Chaos, to the outside bare</l>
                    <l>Of this round world: With pins of adamant</l>
                    <l>And chains they made all fast, too fast they made</l>
                    <l>And durable! And now in little space</l>
                    <l>The confines met of empyrean Heaven,</l>
                    <l>And of this World; and, on the left hand, Hell</l>
                    <l>With long reach interposed; three several ways</l>
                    <l>In sight, to each of these three places led.</l>
                    <l>And now their way to Earth they had descried,</l>
                    <l>To Paradise first tending; when, behold!</l>
                    <l>Satan, in likeness of an Angel bright,</l>
                    <l>Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering</l>
                    <l>His zenith, while the sun in Aries rose:</l>
                    <l>Disguised he came; but those his children dear</l>
                    <l>Their parent soon discerned, though in disguise.</l>
                    <l>He, after Eve seduced, unminded slunk</l>
                    <l>Into the wood fast by; and, changing shape,</l>
                    <l>To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act</l>
                    <l>By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded</l>
                    <l>Upon her husband; saw their shame that sought</l>
                    <l>Vain covertures; but when he saw descend</l>
                    <l>The Son of God to judge them, terrified</l>
                    <l>He fled; not hoping to escape, but shun</l>
                    <l>The present; fearing, guilty, what his wrath</l>
                    <l>Might suddenly inflict; that past, returned</l>
                    <l>By night, and listening where the hapless pair</l>
                    <l>Sat in their sad discourse, and various plaint,</l>
                    <l>Thence gathered his own doom; which understood</l>
                    <l>Not instant, but of future time, with joy</l>
                    <l>And tidings fraught, to Hell he now returned;</l>
                    <l>And at the brink of Chaos, near the foot</l>
                    <l>Of this new wonderous pontifice, unhoped</l>
                    <l>Met, who to meet him came, his offspring dear.</l>
                    <l>Great joy was at their meeting, and at sight</l>
                    <l>Of that stupendous bridge his joy encreased.</l>
                    <l>Long he admiring stood, till Sin, his fair</l>
                    <l>Enchanting daughter, thus the silence broke.</l>
                    <l>O Parent, these are thy magnifick deeds,</l>
                    <l>Thy trophies! which thou viewest as not thine own;</l>
                    <l>Thou art their author, and prime architect:</l>
                    <l>For I no sooner in my heart divined,</l>
                    <l>My heart, which by a secret harmony</l>
                    <l>Still moves with thine, joined in connexion sweet,</l>
                    <l>That thou on earth hadst prospered, which thy looks</l>
                    <l>Now also evidence, but straight I felt,</l>
                    <l>Though distant from thee worlds between, yet felt,</l>
                    <l>That I must after thee, with this thy son;</l>
                    <l>Such fatal consequence unites us three!</l>
                    <l>Hell could no longer hold us in our bounds,</l>
                    <l>Nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure</l>
                    <l>Detain from following thy illustrious track.</l>
                    <l>Thou hast achieved our liberty, confined</l>
                    <l>Within Hell-gates till now; thou us impowered</l>
                    <l>To fortify thus far, and overlay,</l>
                    <l>With this portentous bridge, the dark abyss.</l>
                    <l>Thine now is all this world; thy virtue hath won</l>
                    <l>What thy hands builded not; thy wisdom gained</l>
                    <l>With odds what war hath lost, and fully avenged</l>
                    <l>Our foil in Heaven; here thou shalt monarch reign,</l>
                    <l>There didst not; there let him still victor sway,</l>
                    <l>As battle hath adjudged; from this new world</l>
                    <l>Retiring, by his own doom alienated;</l>
                    <l>And henceforth monarchy with thee divide</l>
                    <l>Of all things, parted by the empyreal bounds,</l>
                    <l>His quadrature, from thy orbicular world;</l>
                    <l>Or try thee now more dangerous to his throne.</l>
                    <l>Whom thus the Prince of darkness answered glad.</l>
                    <l>Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both;</l>
                    <l>High proof ye now have given to be the race</l>
                    <l>Of Satan (for I glory in the name,</l>
                    <l>Antagonist of Heaven’s Almighty King,)</l>
                    <l>Amply have merited of me, of all</l>
                    <l>The infernal empire, that so near Heaven’s door</l>
                    <l>Triumphal with triumphal act have met,</l>
                    <l>Mine, with this glorious work; and made one realm,</l>
                    <l>Hell and this world, one realm, one continent</l>
                    <l>Of easy thorough-fare. Therefore, while I</l>
                    <l>Descend through darkness, on your road with ease,</l>
                    <l>To my associate Powers, them to acquaint</l>
                    <l>With these successes, and with them rejoice;</l>
                    <l>You two this way, among these numerous orbs,</l>
                    <l>All yours, right down to Paradise descend;</l>
                    <l>There dwell, and reign in bliss; thence on the earth</l>
                    <l>Dominion exercise and in the air,</l>
                    <l>Chiefly on Man, sole lord of all declared;</l>
                    <l>Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.</l>
                    <l>My substitutes I send ye, and create</l>
                    <l>Plenipotent on earth, of matchless might</l>
                    <l>Issuing from me: on your joint vigour now</l>
                    <l>My hold of this new kingdom all depends,</l>
                    <l>Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit.</l>
                    <l>If your joint power prevail, the affairs of Hell</l>
                    <l>No detriment need fear; go, and be strong!</l>
                    <l>So saying he dismissed them; they with speed</l>
                    <l>Their course through thickest constellations held,</l>
                    <l>Spreading their bane; the blasted stars looked wan,</l>
                    <l>And planets, planet-struck, real eclipse</l>
                    <l>Then suffered. The other way Satan went down</l>
                    <l>The causey to Hell-gate: On either side</l>
                    <l>Disparted Chaos overbuilt exclaimed,</l>
                    <l>And with rebounding surge the bars assailed,</l>
                    <l>That scorned his indignation: Through the gate,</l>
                    <l>Wide open and unguarded, Satan passed,</l>
                    <l>And all about found desolate; for those,</l>
                    <l>Appointed to sit there, had left their charge,</l>
                    <l>Flown to the upper world; the rest were all</l>
                    <l>Far to the inland retired, about the walls</l>
                    <l>Of Pandemonium; city and proud seat</l>
                    <l>Of Lucifer, so by allusion called</l>
                    <l>Of that bright star to Satan paragoned;</l>
                    <l>There kept their watch the legions, while the Grand</l>
                    <l>In council sat, solicitous what chance</l>
                    <l>Might intercept their emperour sent; so he</l>
                    <l>Departing gave command, and they observed.</l>
                    <l>As when the Tartar from his Russian foe,</l>
                    <l>By Astracan, over the snowy plains,</l>
                    <l>Retires; or Bactrin Sophi, from the horns</l>
                    <l>Of Turkish crescent, leaves all waste beyond</l>
                    <l>The realm of Aladule, in his retreat</l>
                    <l>To Tauris or Casbeen: So these, the late</l>
                    <l>Heaven-banished host, left desart utmost Hell</l>
                    <l>Many a dark league, reduced in careful watch</l>
                    <l>Round their metropolis; and now expecting</l>
                    <l>Each hour their great adventurer, from the search</l>
                    <l>Of foreign worlds: He through the midst unmarked,</l>
                    <l>In show plebeian Angel militant</l>
                    <l>Of lowest order, passed; and from the door</l>
                    <l>Of that Plutonian hall, invisible</l>
                    <l>Ascended his high throne; which, under state</l>
                    <l>Of richest texture spread, at the upper end</l>
                    <l>Was placed in regal lustre. Down a while</l>
                    <l>He sat, and round about him saw unseen:</l>
                    <l>At last, as from a cloud, his fulgent head</l>
                    <l>And shape star-bright appeared, or brighter; clad</l>
                    <l>With what permissive glory since his fall</l>
                    <l>Was left him, or false glitter: All amazed</l>
                    <l>At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng</l>
                    <l>Bent their aspect, and whom they wished beheld,</l>
                    <l>Their mighty Chief returned: loud was the acclaim:</l>
                    <l>Forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers,</l>
                    <l>Raised from their dark Divan, and with like joy</l>
                    <l>Congratulant approached him; who with hand</l>
                    <l>Silence, and with these words attention, won.</l>
                    <l>Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;</l>
                    <l>For in possession such, not only of right,</l>
                    <l>I call ye, and declare ye now; returned</l>
                    <l>Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth</l>
                    <l>Triumphant out of this infernal pit</l>
                    <l>Abominable, accursed, the house of woe,</l>
                    <l>And dungeon of our tyrant: Now possess,</l>
                    <l>As Lords, a spacious world, to our native Heaven</l>
                    <l>Little inferiour, by my adventure hard</l>
                    <l>With peril great achieved. Long were to tell</l>
                    <l>What I have done; what suffered; with what pain</l>
                    <l>Voyaged th’ unreal, vast, unbounded deep</l>
                    <l>Of horrible confusion; over which</l>
                    <l>By Sin and Death a broad way now is paved,</l>
                    <l>To expedite your glorious march; but I</l>
                    <l>Toiled out my uncouth passage, forced to ride</l>
                    <l>The untractable abyss, plunged in the womb</l>
                    <l>Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wild;</l>
                    <l>That, jealous of their secrets, fiercely opposed</l>
                    <l>My journey strange, with clamorous uproar</l>
                    <l>Protesting Fate supreme; thence how I found</l>
                    <l>The new created world, which fame in Heaven</l>
                    <l>Long had foretold, a fabrick wonderful</l>
                    <l>Of absolute perfection! therein Man</l>
                    <l>Placed in a Paradise, by our exile</l>
                    <l>Made happy: Him by fraud I have seduced</l>
                    <l>From his Creator; and, the more to encrease</l>
                    <l>Your wonder, with an apple; he, thereat</l>
                    <l>Offended, worth your laughter! hath given up</l>
                    <l>Both his beloved Man, and all his world,</l>
                    <l>To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us,</l>
                    <l>Without our hazard, labour, or alarm;</l>
                    <l>To range in, and to dwell, and over Man</l>
                    <l>To rule, as over all he should have ruled.</l>
                    <l>True is, me also he hath judged, or rather</l>
                    <l>Me not, but the brute serpent in whose shape</l>
                    <l>Man I deceived: that which to me belongs,</l>
                    <l>Is enmity which he will put between</l>
                    <l>Me and mankind; I am to bruise his heel;</l>
                    <l>His seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head:</l>
                    <l>A world who would not purchase with a bruise,</l>
                    <l>Or much more grievous pain?—Ye have the account</l>
                    <l>Of my performance: What remains, ye Gods,</l>
                    <l>But up, and enter now into full bliss?</l>
                    <l>So having said, a while he stood, expecting</l>
                    <l>Their universal shout, and high applause,</l>
                    <l>To fill his ear; when, contrary, he hears</l>
                    <l>On all sides, from innumerable tongues,</l>
                    <l>A dismal universal hiss, the sound</l>
                    <l>Of publick scorn; he wondered, but not long</l>
                    <l>Had leisure, wondering at himself now more,</l>
                    <l>His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare;</l>
                    <l>His arms clung to his ribs; his legs entwining</l>
                    <l>Each other, till supplanted down he fell</l>
                    <l>A monstrous serpent on his belly prone,</l>
                    <l>Reluctant, but in vain; a greater power</l>
                    <l>Now ruled him, punished in the shape he sinned,</l>
                    <l>According to his doom: he would have spoke,</l>
                    <l>But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue</l>
                    <l>To forked tongue; for now were all transformed</l>
                    <l>Alike, to serpents all, as accessories</l>
                    <l>To his bold riot: Dreadful was the din</l>
                    <l>Of hissing through the hall, thick swarming now</l>
                    <l>With complicated monsters head and tail,</l>
                    <l>Scorpion, and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire,</l>
                    <l>Cerastes horned, Hydrus, and Elops drear,</l>
                    <l>And Dipsas; (not so thick swarmed once the soil</l>
                    <l>Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the isle</l>
                    <l>Ophiusa,) but still greatest he the midst,</l>
                    <l>Now Dragon grown, larger than whom the sun</l>
                    <l>Ingendered in the Pythian vale or slime,</l>
                    <l>Huge Python, and his power no less he seemed</l>
                    <l>Above the rest still to retain; they all</l>
                    <l>Him followed, issuing forth to the open field,</l>
                    <l>Where all yet left of that revolted rout,</l>
                    <l>Heaven-fallen, in station stood or just array;</l>
                    <l>Sublime with expectation when to see</l>
                    <l>In triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief;</l>
                    <l>They saw, but other sight instead! a croud</l>
                    <l>Of ugly serpents; horrour on them fell,</l>
                    <l>And horrid sympathy; for, what they saw,</l>
                    <l>They felt themselves, now changing; down their arms,</l>
                    <l>Down fell both spear and shield; down they as fast;</l>
                    <l>And the dire hiss renewed, and the dire form</l>
                    <l>Catched, by contagion; like in punishment,</l>
                    <l>As in their crime. Thus was the applause they meant,</l>
                    <l>Turned to exploding hiss, triumph to shame</l>
                    <l>Cast on themselves from their own mouths. There stood</l>
                    <l>A grove hard by, sprung up with this their change,</l>
                    <l>His will who reigns above, to aggravate</l>
                    <l>Their penance, laden with fair fruit, like that</l>
                    <l>Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve</l>
                    <l>Used by the Tempter: on that prospect strange</l>
                    <l>Their earnest eyes they fixed, imagining</l>
                    <l>For one forbidden tree a multitude</l>
                    <l>Now risen, to work them further woe or shame;</l>
                    <l>Yet, parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce,</l>
                    <l>Though to delude them sent, could not abstain;</l>
                    <l>But on they rolled in heaps, and, up the trees</l>
                    <l>Climbing, sat thicker than the snaky locks</l>
                    <l>That curled Megaera: greedily they plucked</l>
                    <l>The fruitage fair to sight, like that which grew</l>
                    <l>Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed;</l>
                    <l>This more delusive, not the touch, but taste</l>
                    <l>Deceived; they, fondly thinking to allay</l>
                    <l>Their appetite with gust, instead of fruit</l>
                    <l>Chewed bitter ashes, which the offended taste</l>
                    <l>With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayed,</l>
                    <l>Hunger and thirst constraining; drugged as oft,</l>
                    <l>With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws,</l>
                    <l>With soot and cinders filled; so oft they fell</l>
                    <l>Into the same illusion, not as Man</l>
                    <l>Whom they triumphed once lapsed. Thus were they plagued</l>
                    <l>And worn with famine, long and ceaseless hiss,</l>
                    <l>Till their lost shape, permitted, they resumed;</l>
                    <l>Yearly enjoined, some say, to undergo,</l>
                    <l>This annual humbling certain numbered days,</l>
                    <l>To dash their pride, and joy, for Man seduced.</l>
                    <l>However, some tradition they dispersed</l>
                    <l>Among the Heathen, of their purchase got,</l>
                    <l>And fabled how the Serpent, whom they called</l>
                    <l>Ophion, with Eurynome, the wide—</l>
                    <l>Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule</l>
                    <l>Of high Olympus; thence by Saturn driven</l>
                    <l>And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born.</l>
                    <l>Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair</l>
                    <l>Too soon arrived; Sin, there in power before,</l>
                    <l>Once actual; now in body, and to dwell</l>
                    <l>Habitual habitant; behind her Death,</l>
                    <l>Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet</l>
                    <l>On his pale horse: to whom Sin thus began.</l>
                    <l>Second of Satan sprung, all-conquering Death!</l>
                    <l>What thinkest thou of our empire now, though earned</l>
                    <l>With travel difficult, not better far</l>
                    <l>Than still at Hell’s dark threshold to have sat watch,</l>
                    <l>Unnamed, undreaded, and thyself half starved?</l>
                    <l>Whom thus the Sin-born monster answered soon.</l>
                    <l>To me, who with eternal famine pine,</l>
                    <l>Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven;</l>
                    <l>There best, where most with ravine I may meet;</l>
                    <l>Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems</l>
                    <l>To stuff this maw, this vast unhide-bound corps.</l>
                    <l>To whom the incestuous mother thus replied.</l>
                    <l>Thou therefore on these herbs, and fruits, and flowers,</l>
                    <l>Feed first; on each beast next, and fish, and fowl;</l>
                    <l>No homely morsels! and, whatever thing</l>
                    <l>The sithe of Time mows down, devour unspared;</l>
                    <l>Till I, in Man residing, through the race,</l>
                    <l>His thoughts, his looks, words, actions, all infect;</l>
                    <l>And season him thy last and sweetest prey.</l>
                    <l>This said, they both betook them several ways,</l>
                    <l>Both to destroy, or unimmortal make</l>
                    <l>All kinds, and for destruction to mature</l>
                    <l>Sooner or later; which the Almighty seeing,</l>
                    <l>From his transcendent seat the Saints among,</l>
                    <l>To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice.</l>
                    <l>See, with what heat these dogs of Hell advance</l>
                    <l>To waste and havock yonder world, which I</l>
                    <l>So fair and good created; and had still</l>
                    <l>Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man</l>
                    <l>Let in these wasteful furies, who impute</l>
                    <l>Folly to me; so doth the Prince of Hell</l>
                    <l>And his adherents, that with so much ease</l>
                    <l>I suffer them to enter and possess</l>
                    <l>A place so heavenly; and, conniving, seem</l>
                    <l>To gratify my scornful enemies,</l>
                    <l>That laugh, as if, transported with some fit</l>
                    <l>Of passion, I to them had quitted all,</l>
                    <l>At random yielded up to their misrule;</l>
                    <l>And know not that I called, and drew them thither,</l>
                    <l>My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth</l>
                    <l>Which Man’s polluting sin with taint hath shed</l>
                    <l>On what was pure; til, crammed and gorged, nigh burst</l>
                    <l>With sucked and glutted offal, at one sling</l>
                    <l>Of thy victorious arm, well-pleasing Son,</l>
                    <l>Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave, at last,</l>
                    <l>Through Chaos hurled, obstruct the mouth of Hell</l>
                    <l>For ever, and seal up his ravenous jaws.</l>
                    <l>Then Heaven and Earth renewed shall be made pure</l>
                    <l>To sanctity, that shall receive no stain:</l>
                    <l>Till then, the curse pronounced on both precedes.</l>
                    <l>He ended, and the heavenly audience loud</l>
                    <l>Sung Halleluiah, as the sound of seas,</l>
                    <l>Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways,</l>
                    <l>Righteous are thy decrees on all thy works;</l>
                    <l>Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son,</l>
                    <l>Destined Restorer of mankind, by whom</l>
                    <l>New Heaven and Earth shall to the ages rise,</l>
                    <l>Or down from Heaven descend.—Such was their song;</l>
                    <l>While the Creator, calling forth by name</l>
                    <l>His mighty Angels, gave them several charge,</l>
                    <l>As sorted best with present things. The sun</l>
                    <l>Had first his precept so to move, so shine,</l>
                    <l>As might affect the earth with cold and heat</l>
                    <l>Scarce tolerable; and from the north to call</l>
                    <l>Decrepit winter; from the south to bring</l>
                    <l>Solstitial summer’s heat. To the blanc moon</l>
                    <l>Her office they prescribed; to the other five</l>
                    <l>Their planetary motions, and aspects,</l>
                    <l>In sextile, square, and trine, and opposite,</l>
                    <l>Of noxious efficacy, and when to join</l>
                    <l>In synod unbenign; and taught the fixed</l>
                    <l>Their influence malignant when to shower,</l>
                    <l>Which of them rising with the sun, or falling,</l>
                    <l>Should prove tempestuous: To the winds they set</l>
                    <l>Their corners, when with bluster to confound</l>
                    <l>Sea, air, and shore; the thunder when to roll</l>
                    <l>With terrour through the dark aereal hall.</l>
                    <l>Some say, he bid his Angels turn ascanse</l>
                    <l>The poles of earth, twice ten degrees and more,</l>
                    <l>From the sun’s axle; they with labour pushed</l>
                    <l>Oblique the centrick globe: Some say, the sun</l>
                    <l>Was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road</l>
                    <l>Like distant breadth to Taurus with the seven</l>
                    <l>Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins,</l>
                    <l>Up to the Tropick Crab: thence down amain</l>
                    <l>By Leo, and the Virgin, and the Scales,</l>
                    <l>As deep as Capricorn; to bring in change</l>
                    <l>Of seasons to each clime; else had the spring</l>
                    <l>Perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flowers,</l>
                    <l>Equal in days and nights, except to those</l>
                    <l>Beyond the polar circles; to them day</l>
                    <l>Had unbenighted shone, while the low sun,</l>
                    <l>To recompense his distance, in their sight</l>
                    <l>Had rounded still the horizon, and not known</l>
                    <l>Or east or west; which had forbid the snow</l>
                    <l>From cold Estotiland, and south as far</l>
                    <l>Beneath Magellan. At that tasted fruit</l>
                    <l>The sun, as from Thyestean banquet, turned</l>
                    <l>His course intended; else, how had the world</l>
                    <l>Inhabited, though sinless, more than now,</l>
                    <l>Avoided pinching cold and scorching heat?</l>
                    <l>These changes in the Heavens, though slow, produced</l>
                    <l>Like change on sea and land; sideral blast,</l>
                    <l>Vapour, and mist, and exhalation hot,</l>
                    <l>Corrupt and pestilent: Now from the north</l>
                    <l>Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shore,</l>
                    <l>Bursting their brazen dungeon, armed with ice,</l>
                    <l>And snow, and hail, and stormy gust and flaw,</l>
                    <l>Boreas, and Caecias, and Argestes loud,</l>
                    <l>And Thrascias, rend the woods, and seas upturn;</l>
                    <l>With adverse blast upturns them from the south</l>
                    <l>Notus, and Afer black with thunderous clouds</l>
                    <l>From Serraliona; thwart of these, as fierce,</l>
                    <l>Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent winds,</l>
                    <l>Eurus and Zephyr, with their lateral noise,</l>
                    <l>Sirocco and Libecchio. Thus began</l>
                    <l>Outrage from lifeless things; but Discord first,</l>
                    <l>Daughter of Sin, among the irrational</l>
                    <l>Death introduced, through fierce antipathy:</l>
                    <l>Beast now with beast ’gan war, and fowl with fowl,</l>
                    <l>And fish with fish; to graze the herb all leaving,</l>
                    <l>Devoured each other; nor stood much in awe</l>
                    <l>Of Man, but fled him; or, with countenance grim,</l>
                    <l>Glared on him passing. These were from without</l>
                    <l>The growing miseries, which Adam saw</l>
                    <l>Already in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,</l>
                    <l>To sorrow abandoned, but worse felt within;</l>
                    <l>And, in a troubled sea of passion tost,</l>
                    <l>Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint.</l>
                    <l>O miserable of happy! Is this the end</l>
                    <l>Of this new glorious world, and me so late</l>
                    <l>The glory of that glory, who now become</l>
                    <l>Accursed, of blessed? hide me from the face</l>
                    <l>Of God, whom to behold was then my highth</l>
                    <l>Of happiness!—Yet well, if here would end</l>
                    <l>The misery; I deserved it, and would bear</l>
                    <l>My own deservings; but this will not serve:</l>
                    <l>All that I eat or drink, or shall beget,</l>
                    <l>Is propagated curse. O voice, once heard</l>
                    <l>Delightfully, Encrease and multiply;</l>
                    <l>Now death to hear! for what can I encrease,</l>
                    <l>Or multiply, but curses on my head?</l>
                    <l>Who of all ages to succeed, but, feeling</l>
                    <l>The evil on him brought by me, will curse</l>
                    <l>My head? Ill fare our ancestor impure,</l>
                    <l>For this we may thank Adam! but his thanks</l>
                    <l>Shall be the execration: so, besides</l>
                    <l>Mine own that bide upon me, all from me</l>
                    <l>Shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound;</l>
                    <l>On me, as on their natural center, light</l>
                    <l>Heavy, though in their place. O fleeting joys</l>
                    <l>Of Paradise, dear bought with lasting woes!</l>
                    <l>Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay</l>
                    <l>To mould me Man? did I solicit thee</l>
                    <l>From darkness to promote me, or here place</l>
                    <l>In this delicious garden? As my will</l>
                    <l>Concurred not to my being, it were but right</l>
                    <l>And equal to reduce me to my dust;</l>
                    <l>Desirous to resign and render back</l>
                    <l>All I received; unable to perform</l>
                    <l>Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold</l>
                    <l>The good I sought not. To the loss of that,</l>
                    <l>Sufficient penalty, why hast thou added</l>
                    <l>The sense of endless woes? Inexplicable</l>
                    <l>Thy justice seems; yet to say truth, too late</l>
                    <l>I thus contest; then should have been refused</l>
                    <l>Those terms whatever, when they were proposed:</l>
                    <l>Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good,</l>
                    <l>Then cavil the conditions? And, though God</l>
                    <l>Made thee without thy leave, what if thy son</l>
                    <l>Prove disobedient, and reproved, retort,</l>
                    <l>“Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not!”</l>
                    <l>Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee</l>
                    <l>That proud excuse? yet him not thy election,</l>
                    <l>But natural necessity begot.</l>
                    <l>God made thee of choice his own, and of his own</l>
                    <l>To serve him; thy reward was of his grace;</l>
                    <l>Thy punishment then, justly is at his will.</l>
                    <l>Be it so, for I submit; his doom is fair,</l>
                    <l>That dust I am, and shall to dust return.</l>
                    <l>O welcome hour whenever! Why delays</l>
                    <l>His hand to execute what his decree</l>
                    <l>Fixed on this day? Why do I overlive,</l>
                    <l>Why am I mocked with death, and lengthened out</l>
                    <l>To deathless pain? How gladly would I meet</l>
                    <l>Mortality my sentence, and be earth</l>
                    <l>Insensible! How glad would lay me down</l>
                    <l>As in my mother’s lap! There I should rest,</l>
                    <l>And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more</l>
                    <l>Would thunder in my ears; no fear of worse</l>
                    <l>To me, and to my offspring, would torment me</l>
                    <l>With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt</l>
                    <l>Pursues me still, lest all I cannot die;</l>
                    <l>Lest that pure breath of life, the spirit of Man</l>
                    <l>Which God inspired, cannot together perish</l>
                    <l>With this corporeal clod; then, in the grave,</l>
                    <l>Or in some other dismal place, who knows</l>
                    <l>But I shall die a living death? O thought</l>
                    <l>Horrid, if true! Yet why? It was but breath</l>
                    <l>Of life that sinned; what dies but what had life</l>
                    <l>And sin? The body properly had neither,</l>
                    <l>All of me then shall die: let this appease</l>
                    <l>The doubt, since human reach no further knows.</l>
                    <l>For though the Lord of all be infinite,</l>
                    <l>Is his wrath also? Be it, Man is not so,</l>
                    <l>But mortal doomed. How can he exercise</l>
                    <l>Wrath without end on Man, whom death must end?</l>
                    <l>Can he make deathless death? That were to make</l>
                    <l>Strange contradiction, which to God himself</l>
                    <l>Impossible is held; as argument</l>
                    <l>Of weakness, not of power. Will he draw out,</l>
                    <l>For anger’s sake, finite to infinite,</l>
                    <l>In punished Man, to satisfy his rigour,</l>
                    <l>Satisfied never? That were to extend</l>
                    <l>His sentence beyond dust and Nature’s law;</l>
                    <l>By which all causes else, according still</l>
                    <l>To the reception of their matter, act;</l>
                    <l>Not to the extent of their own sphere. But say</l>
                    <l>That death be not one stroke, as I supposed,</l>
                    <l>Bereaving sense, but endless misery</l>
                    <l>From this day onward; which I feel begun</l>
                    <l>Both in me, and without me; and so last</l>
                    <l>To perpetuity;—Ay me! that fear</l>
                    <l>Comes thundering back with dreadful revolution</l>
                    <l>On my defenceless head; both Death and I</l>
                    <l>Am found eternal, and incorporate both;</l>
                    <l>Nor I on my part single; in me all</l>
                    <l>Posterity stands cursed: Fair patrimony</l>
                    <l>That I must leave ye, Sons! O, were I able</l>
                    <l>To waste it all myself, and leave ye none!</l>
                    <l>So disinherited, how would you bless</l>
                    <l>Me, now your curse! Ah, why should all mankind,</l>
                    <l>For one man’s fault, thus guiltless be condemned,</l>
                    <l>It guiltless? But from me what can proceed,</l>
                    <l>But all corrupt; both mind and will depraved</l>
                    <l>Not to do only, but to will the same</l>
                    <l>With me? How can they then acquitted stand</l>
                    <l>In sight of God? Him, after all disputes,</l>
                    <l>Forced I absolve: all my evasions vain,</l>
                    <l>And reasonings, though through mazes, lead me still</l>
                    <l>But to my own conviction: first and last</l>
                    <l>On me, me only, as the source and spring</l>
                    <l>Of all corruption, all the blame lights due;</l>
                    <l>So might the wrath! Fond wish! couldst thou support</l>
                    <l>That burden, heavier than the earth to bear;</l>
                    <l>Than all the world much heavier, though divided</l>
                    <l>With that bad Woman? Thus, what thou desirest,</l>
                    <l>And what thou fearest, alike destroys all hope</l>
                    <l>Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable</l>
                    <l>Beyond all past example and future;</l>
                    <l>To Satan only like both crime and doom.</l>
                    <l>O Conscience! into what abyss of fears</l>
                    <l>And horrours hast thou driven me; out of which</l>
                    <l>I find no way, from deep to deeper plunged!</l>
                    <l>Thus Adam to himself lamented loud,</l>
                    <l>Through the still night; not now, as ere Man fell,</l>
                    <l>Wholesome, and cool, and mild, but with black air</l>
                    <l>Accompanied; with damps, and dreadful gloom;</l>
                    <l>Which to his evil conscience represented</l>
                    <l>All things with double terrour: On the ground</l>
                    <l>Outstretched he lay, on the cold ground; and oft</l>
                    <l>Cursed his creation; Death as oft accused</l>
                    <l>Of tardy execution, since denounced</l>
                    <l>The day of his offence. Why comes not Death,</l>
                    <l>Said he, with one thrice-acceptable stroke</l>
                    <l>To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word,</l>
                    <l>Justice Divine not hasten to be just?</l>
                    <l>But Death comes not at call; Justice Divine</l>
                    <l>Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries,</l>
                    <l>O woods, O fountains, hillocks, dales, and bowers!</l>
                    <l>With other echo late I taught your shades</l>
                    <l>To answer, and resound far other song.—</l>
                    <l>Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld,</l>
                    <l>Desolate where she sat, approaching nigh,</l>
                    <l>Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed:</l>
                    <l>But her with stern regard he thus repelled.</l>
                    <l>Out of my sight, thou Serpent! That name best</l>
                    <l>Befits thee with him leagued, thyself as false</l>
                    <l>And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape,</l>
                    <l>Like his, and colour serpentine, may show</l>
                    <l>Thy inward fraud; to warn all creatures from thee</l>
                    <l>Henceforth; lest that too heavenly form, pretended</l>
                    <l>To hellish falshood, snare them! But for thee</l>
                    <l>I had persisted happy; had not thy pride</l>
                    <l>And wandering vanity, when least was safe,</l>
                    <l>Rejected my forewarning, and disdained</l>
                    <l>Not to be trusted; longing to be seen,</l>
                    <l>Though by the Devil himself; him overweening</l>
                    <l>To over-reach; but, with the serpent meeting,</l>
                    <l>Fooled and beguiled; by him thou, I by thee</l>
                    <l>To trust thee from my side; imagined wise,</l>
                    <l>Constant, mature, proof against all assaults;</l>
                    <l>And understood not all was but a show,</l>
                    <l>Rather than solid virtue; all but a rib</l>
                    <l>Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears,</l>
                    <l>More to the part sinister, from me drawn;</l>
                    <l>Well if thrown out, as supernumerary</l>
                    <l>To my just number found. O! why did God,</l>
                    <l>Creator wise, that peopled highest Heaven</l>
                    <l>With Spirits masculine, create at last</l>
                    <l>This novelty on earth, this fair defect</l>
                    <l>Of nature, and not fill the world at once</l>
                    <l>With Men, as Angels, without feminine;</l>
                    <l>Or find some other way to generate</l>
                    <l>Mankind? This mischief had not been befallen,</l>
                    <l>And more that shall befall; innumerable</l>
                    <l>Disturbances on earth through female snares,</l>
                    <l>And strait conjunction with this sex: for either</l>
                    <l>He never shall find out fit mate, but such</l>
                    <l>As some misfortune brings him, or mistake;</l>
                    <l>Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain</l>
                    <l>Through her perverseness, but shall see her gained</l>
                    <l>By a far worse; or, if she love, withheld</l>
                    <l>By parents; or his happiest choice too late</l>
                    <l>Shall meet, already linked and wedlock-bound</l>
                    <l>To a fell adversary, his hate or shame:</l>
                    <l>Which infinite calamity shall cause</l>
                    <l>To human life, and houshold peace confound.</l>
                    <l>He added not, and from her turned; but Eve,</l>
                    <l>Not so repulsed, with tears that ceased not flowing</l>
                    <l>And tresses all disordered, at his feet</l>
                    <l>Fell humble; and, embracing them, besought</l>
                    <l>His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint.</l>
                    <l>Forsake me not thus, Adam! witness Heaven</l>
                    <l>What love sincere, and reverence in my heart</l>
                    <l>I bear thee, and unweeting have offended,</l>
                    <l>Unhappily deceived! Thy suppliant</l>
                    <l>I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not,</l>
                    <l>Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid,</l>
                    <l>Thy counsel, in this uttermost distress,</l>
                    <l>My only strength and stay: Forlorn of thee,</l>
                    <l>Whither shall I betake me, where subsist?</l>
                    <l>While yet we live, scarce one short hour perhaps,</l>
                    <l>Between us two let there be peace; both joining,</l>
                    <l>As joined in injuries, one enmity</l>
                    <l>Against a foe by doom express assigned us,</l>
                    <l>That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not</l>
                    <l>Thy hatred for this misery befallen;</l>
                    <l>On me already lost, me than thyself</l>
                    <l>More miserable! Both have sinned; but thou</l>
                    <l>Against God only; I against God and thee;</l>
                    <l>And to the place of judgement will return,</l>
                    <l>There with my cries importune Heaven; that all</l>
                    <l>The sentence, from thy head removed, may light</l>
                    <l>On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe;</l>
                    <l>Me, me only, just object of his ire!</l>
                    <l>She ended weeping; and her lowly plight,</l>
                    <l>Immoveable, till peace obtained from fault</l>
                    <l>Acknowledged and deplored, in Adam wrought</l>
                    <l>Commiseration: Soon his heart relented</l>
                    <l>Towards her, his life so late, and sole delight,</l>
                    <l>Now at his feet submissive in distress;</l>
                    <l>Creature so fair his reconcilement seeking,</l>
                    <l>His counsel, whom she had displeased, his aid:</l>
                    <l>As one disarmed, his anger all he lost,</l>
                    <l>And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon.</l>
                    <l>Unwary, and too desirous, as before,</l>
                    <l>So now of what thou knowest not, who desirest</l>
                    <l>The punishment all on thyself; alas!</l>
                    <l>Bear thine own first, ill able to sustain</l>
                    <l>His full wrath, whose thou feelest as yet least part,</l>
                    <l>And my displeasure bearest so ill. If prayers</l>
                    <l>Could alter high decrees, I to that place</l>
                    <l>Would speed before thee, and be louder heard,</l>
                    <l>That on my head all might be visited;</l>
                    <l>Thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven,</l>
                    <l>To me committed, and by me exposed.</l>
                    <l>But rise;—let us no more contend, nor blame</l>
                    <l>Each other, blamed enough elsewhere; but strive</l>
                    <l>In offices of love, how we may lighten</l>
                    <l>Each other’s burden, in our share of woe;</l>
                    <l>Since this day’s death denounced, if aught I see,</l>
                    <l>Will prove no sudden, but a slow-paced evil;</l>
                    <l>A long day’s dying, to augment our pain;</l>
                    <l>And to our seed (O hapless seed!) derived.</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, replied.</l>
                    <l>Adam, by sad experiment I know</l>
                    <l>How little weight my words with thee can find,</l>
                    <l>Found so erroneous; thence by just event</l>
                    <l>Found so unfortunate: Nevertheless,</l>
                    <l>Restored by thee, vile as I am, to place</l>
                    <l>Of new acceptance, hopeful to regain</l>
                    <l>Thy love, the sole contentment of my heart</l>
                    <l>Living or dying, from thee I will not hide</l>
                    <l>What thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen,</l>
                    <l>Tending to some relief of our extremes,</l>
                    <l>Or end; though sharp and sad, yet tolerable,</l>
                    <l>As in our evils, and of easier choice.</l>
                    <l>If care of our descent perplex us most,</l>
                    <l>Which must be born to certain woe, devoured</l>
                    <l>By Death at last; and miserable it is</l>
                    <l>To be to others cause of misery,</l>
                    <l>Our own begotten, and of our loins to bring</l>
                    <l>Into this cursed world a woeful race,</l>
                    <l>That after wretched life must be at last</l>
                    <l>Food for so foul a monster; in thy power</l>
                    <l>It lies, yet ere conception to prevent</l>
                    <l>The race unblest, to being yet unbegot.</l>
                    <l>Childless thou art, childless remain: so Death</l>
                    <l>Shall be deceived his glut, and with us two</l>
                    <l>Be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw.</l>
                    <l>But if thou judge it hard and difficult,</l>
                    <l>Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain</l>
                    <l>From love’s due rights, nuptial embraces sweet;</l>
                    <l>And with desire to languish without hope,</l>
                    <l>Before the present object languishing</l>
                    <l>With like desire; which would be misery</l>
                    <l>And torment less than none of what we dread;</l>
                    <l>Then, both ourselves and seed at once to free</l>
                    <l>From what we fear for both, let us make short,—</l>
                    <l>Let us seek Death;—or, he not found, supply</l>
                    <l>With our own hands his office on ourselves:</l>
                    <l>Why stand we longer shivering under fears,</l>
                    <l>That show no end but death, and have the power,</l>
                    <l>Of many ways to die the shortest choosing,</l>
                    <l>Destruction with destruction to destroy?—</l>
                    <l>She ended here, or vehement despair</l>
                    <l>Broke off the rest: so much of death her thoughts</l>
                    <l>Had entertained, as dyed her cheeks with pale.</l>
                    <l>But Adam, with such counsel nothing swayed,</l>
                    <l>To better hopes his more attentive mind</l>
                    <l>Labouring had raised; and thus to Eve replied.</l>
                    <l>Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems</l>
                    <l>To argue in thee something more sublime</l>
                    <l>And excellent, than what thy mind contemns;</l>
                    <l>But self-destruction therefore sought, refutes</l>
                    <l>That excellence thought in thee; and implies,</l>
                    <l>Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret</l>
                    <l>For loss of life and pleasure overloved.</l>
                    <l>Or if thou covet death, as utmost end</l>
                    <l>Of misery, so thinking to evade</l>
                    <l>The penalty pronounced; doubt not but God</l>
                    <l>Hath wiselier armed his vengeful ire, than so</l>
                    <l>To be forestalled; much more I fear lest death,</l>
                    <l>So snatched, will not exempt us from the pain</l>
                    <l>We are by doom to pay; rather, such acts</l>
                    <l>Of contumacy will provoke the Highest</l>
                    <l>To make death in us live: Then let us seek</l>
                    <l>Some safer resolution, which methinks</l>
                    <l>I have in view, calling to mind with heed</l>
                    <l>Part of our sentence, that thy seed shall bruise</l>
                    <l>The Serpent’s head; piteous amends! unless</l>
                    <l>Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand foe,</l>
                    <l>Satan; who, in the serpent, hath contrived</l>
                    <l>Against us this deceit: To crush his head</l>
                    <l>Would be revenge indeed! which will be lost</l>
                    <l>By death brought on ourselves, or childless days</l>
                    <l>Resolved, as thou proposest; so our foe</l>
                    <l>Shal ’scape his punishment ordained, and we</l>
                    <l>Instead shall double ours upon our heads.</l>
                    <l>No more be mentioned then of violence</l>
                    <l>Against ourselves; and wilful barrenness,</l>
                    <l>That cuts us off from hope; and savours only</l>
                    <l>Rancour and pride, impatience and despite,</l>
                    <l>Reluctance against God and his just yoke</l>
                    <l>Laid on our necks. Remember with what mild</l>
                    <l>And gracious temper he both heard, and judged,</l>
                    <l>Without wrath or reviling; we expected</l>
                    <l>Immediate dissolution, which we thought</l>
                    <l>Was meant by death that day; when lo! to thee</l>
                    <l>Pains only in child-bearing were foretold,</l>
                    <l>And bringing forth; soon recompensed with joy,</l>
                    <l>Fruit of thy womb: On me the curse aslope</l>
                    <l>Glanced on the ground; with labour I must earn</l>
                    <l>My bread; what harm? Idleness had been worse;</l>
                    <l>My labour will sustain me; and, lest cold</l>
                    <l>Or heat should injure us, his timely care</l>
                    <l>Hath, unbesought, provided; and his hands</l>
                    <l>Clothed us unworthy, pitying while he judged;</l>
                    <l>How much more, if we pray him, will his ear</l>
                    <l>Be open, and his heart to pity incline,</l>
                    <l>And teach us further by what means to shun</l>
                    <l>The inclement seasons, rain, ice, hail, and snow!</l>
                    <l>Which now the sky, with various face, begins</l>
                    <l>To show us in this mountain; while the winds</l>
                    <l>Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks</l>
                    <l>Of these fair spreading trees; which bids us seek</l>
                    <l>Some better shroud, some better warmth to cherish</l>
                    <l>Our limbs benummed, ere this diurnal star</l>
                    <l>Leave cold the night, how we his gathered beams</l>
                    <l>Reflected may with matter sere foment;</l>
                    <l>Or, by collision of two bodies, grind</l>
                    <l>The air attrite to fire; as late the clouds</l>
                    <l>Justling, or pushed with winds, rude in their shock,</l>
                    <l>Tine the slant lightning; whose thwart flame, driven down</l>
                    <l>Kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine;</l>
                    <l>And sends a comfortable heat from far,</l>
                    <l>Which might supply the sun: Such fire to use,</l>
                    <l>And what may else be remedy or cure</l>
                    <l>To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought,</l>
                    <l>He will instruct us praying, and of grace</l>
                    <l>Beseeching him; so as we need not fear</l>
                    <l>To pass commodiously this life, sustained</l>
                    <l>By him with many comforts, till we end</l>
                    <l>In dust, our final rest and native home.</l>
                    <l>What better can we do, than, to the place</l>
                    <l>Repairing where he judged us, prostrate fall</l>
                    <l>Before him reverent; and there confess</l>
                    <l>Humbly our faults, and pardon beg; with tears</l>
                    <l>Watering the ground, and with our sighs the air</l>
                    <l>Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign</l>
                    <l>Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek.</l>
                    <l>Undoubtedly he will relent, and turn</l>
                    <l>From his displeasure; in whose look serene,</l>
                    <l>When angry most he seemed and most severe,</l>
                    <l>What else but favour, grace, and mercy, shone?</l>
                    <l>So spake our father penitent; nor Eve</l>
                    <l>Felt less remorse: they, forthwith to the place</l>
                    <l>Repairing where he judged them, prostrate fell</l>
                    <l>Before him reverent; and both confessed</l>
                    <l>Humbly their faults, and pardon begged; with tears</l>
                    <l>Watering the ground, and with their sighs the air</l>
                    <l>Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign</l>
                    <l>Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek.</l>

                    <l>Thus they, in lowliest plight, repentant stood</l>
                    <l>Praying; for from the mercy-seat above</l>
                    <l>Prevenient grace descending had removed</l>
                    <l>The stony from their hearts, and made new flesh</l>
                    <l>Regenerate grow instead; that sighs now breathed</l>
                    <l>Unutterable; which the Spirit of prayer</l>
                    <l>Inspired, and winged for Heaven with speedier flight</l>
                    <l>Than loudest oratory: Yet their port</l>
                    <l>Not of mean suitors; nor important less</l>
                    <l>Seemed their petition, than when the ancient pair</l>

                    <l>Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha, to restore</l>
                    <l>The race of mankind drowned, before the shrine</l>
                    <l>Of Themis stood devout. To Heaven their prayers</l>
                    <l>Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious winds</l>
                    <l>Blown vagabond or frustrate: in they passed</l>
                    <l>Dimensionless through heavenly doors; then clad</l>
                    <l>With incense, where the golden altar fumed,</l>
                    <l>By their great intercessour, came in sight</l>
                    <l>Before the Father’s throne: them the glad Son</l>
                    <l>Presenting, thus to intercede began.</l>
                    <l>See Father, what first-fruits on earth are sprung</l>
                    <l>From thy implanted grace in Man; these sighs</l>
                    <l>And prayers, which in this golden censer mixed</l>
                    <l>With incense, I thy priest before thee bring;</l>
                    <l>Fruits of more pleasing savour, from thy seed</l>
                    <l>Sown with contrition in his heart, than those</l>
                    <l>Which, his own hand manuring, all the trees</l>
                    <l>Of Paradise could have produced, ere fallen</l>
                    <l>From innocence. Now therefore, bend thine ear</l>
                    <l>To supplication; hear his sighs, though mute;</l>
                    <l>Unskilful with what words to pray, let me</l>
                    <l>Interpret for him; me, his advocate</l>
                    <l>And propitiation; all his works on me,</l>
                    <l>Good, or not good, ingraft; my merit those</l>
                    <l>Shall perfect, and for these my death shall pay.</l>
                    <l>Accept me; and, in me, from these receive</l>
                    <l>The smell of peace toward mankind: let him live</l>
                    <l>Before thee reconciled, at least his days</l>
                    <l>Numbered, though sad; till death, his doom, (which I</l>
                    <l>To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse,)</l>
                    <l>To better life shall yield him: where with me</l>
                    <l>All my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss;</l>
                    <l>Made one with me, as I with thee am one.</l>
                    <l>To whom the Father, without cloud, serene.</l>
                    <l>All thy request for Man, accepted Son,</l>
                    <l>Obtain; all thy request was my decree:</l>
                    <l>But, longer in that Paradise to dwell,</l>
                    <l>The law I gave to Nature him forbids:</l>
                    <l>Those pure immortal elements, that know,</l>
                    <l>No gross, no unharmonious mixture foul,</l>
                    <l>Eject him, tainted now; and purge him off,</l>
                    <l>As a distemper, gross, to air as gross,</l>
                    <l>And mortal food; as may dispose him best</l>
                    <l>For dissolution wrought by sin, that first</l>
                    <l>Distempered all things, and of incorrupt</l>
                    <l>Corrupted. I, at first, with two fair gifts</l>
                    <l>Created him endowed; with happiness,</l>
                    <l>And immortality: that fondly lost,</l>
                    <l>This other served but to eternize woe;</l>
                    <l>Till I provided death: so death becomes</l>
                    <l>His final remedy; and, after life,</l>
                    <l>Tried in sharp tribulation, and refined</l>
                    <l>By faith and faithful works, to second life,</l>
                    <l>Waked in the renovation of the just,</l>
                    <l>Resigns him up with Heaven and Earth renewed.</l>
                    <l>But let us call to synod all the Blest,</l>
                    <l>Through Heaven’s wide bounds: from them I will not hide</l>
                    <l>My judgements; how with mankind I proceed,</l>
                    <l>As how with peccant Angels late they saw,</l>
                    <l>And in their state, though firm, stood more confirmed.</l>
                    <l>He ended, and the Son gave signal high</l>
                    <l>To the bright minister that watched; he blew</l>
                    <l>His trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps</l>
                    <l>When God descended, and perhaps once more</l>
                    <l>To sound at general doom. The angelick blast</l>
                    <l>Filled all the regions: from their blisful bowers</l>
                    <l>Of amarantine shade, fountain or spring,</l>
                    <l>By the waters of life, where’er they sat</l>
                    <l>In fellowships of joy, the sons of light</l>
                    <l>Hasted, resorting to the summons high;</l>
                    <l>And took their seats; till from his throne supreme</l>
                    <l>The Almighty thus pronounced his sovran will.</l>
                    <l>O Sons, like one of us Man is become</l>
                    <l>To know both good and evil, since his taste</l>
                    <l>Of that defended fruit; but let him boast</l>
                    <l>His knowledge of good lost, and evil got;</l>
                    <l>Happier! had it sufficed him to have known</l>
                    <l>Good by itself, and evil not at all.</l>
                    <l>He sorrows now, repents, and prays contrite,</l>
                    <l>My motions in him; longer than they move,</l>
                    <l>His heart I know, how variable and vain,</l>
                    <l>Self-left. Lest therefore his now bolder hand</l>
                    <l>Reach also of the tree of life, and eat,</l>
                    <l>And live for ever, dream at least to live</l>
                    <l>For ever, to remove him I decree,</l>
                    <l>And send him from the garden forth to till</l>
                    <l>The ground whence he was taken, fitter soil.</l>
                    <l>Michael, this my behest have thou in charge;</l>
                    <l>Take to thee from among the Cherubim</l>
                    <l>Thy choice of flaming warriours, lest the Fiend,</l>
                    <l>Or in behalf of Man, or to invade</l>
                    <l>Vacant possession, some new trouble raise:</l>
                    <l>Haste thee, and from the Paradise of God</l>
                    <l>Without remorse drive out the sinful pair;</l>
                    <l>From hallowed ground the unholy; and denounce</l>
                    <l>To them, and to their progeny, from thence</l>
                    <l>Perpetual banishment. Yet, lest they faint</l>
                    <l>At the sad sentence rigorously urged,</l>
                    <l>(For I behold them softened, and with tears</l>
                    <l>Bewailing their excess,) all terrour hide.</l>
                    <l>If patiently thy bidding they obey,</l>
                    <l>Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveal</l>
                    <l>To Adam what shall come in future days,</l>
                    <l>As I shall thee enlighten; intermix</l>
                    <l>My covenant in the Woman’s seed renewed;</l>
                    <l>So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:</l>
                    <l>And on the east side of the garden place,</l>
                    <l>Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbs,</l>
                    <l>Cherubick watch; and of a sword the flame</l>
                    <l>Wide-waving; all approach far off to fright,</l>
                    <l>And guard all passage to the tree of life:</l>
                    <l>Lest Paradise a receptacle prove</l>
                    <l>To Spirits foul, and all my trees their prey;</l>
                    <l>With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude.</l>
                    <l>He ceased; and the arch-angelick Power prepared</l>
                    <l>For swift descent; with him the cohort bright</l>
                    <l>Of watchful Cherubim: four faces each</l>
                    <l>Had, like a double Janus; all their shape</l>
                    <l>Spangled with eyes more numerous than those</l>
                    <l>Of Argus, and more wakeful than to drouse,</l>
                    <l>Charmed with Arcadian pipe, the pastoral reed</l>
                    <l>Of Hermes, or his opiate rod. Mean while,</l>
                    <l>To re-salute the world with sacred light,</l>
                    <l>Leucothea waked; and with fresh dews imbalmed</l>
                    <l>The earth; when Adam and first matron Eve</l>
                    <l>Had ended now their orisons, and found</l>
                    <l>Strength added from above; new hope to spring</l>
                    <l>Out of despair; joy, but with fear yet linked;</l>
                    <l>Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewed.</l>
                    <l>Eve, easily my faith admit, that all</l>
                    <l>The good which we enjoy from Heaven descends;</l>
                    <l>But, that from us aught should ascend to Heaven</l>
                    <l>So prevalent as to concern the mind</l>
                    <l>Of God high-blest, or to incline his will,</l>
                    <l>Hard to belief may seem; yet this will prayer</l>
                    <l>Or one short sigh of human breath, upborne</l>
                    <l>Even to the seat of God. For since I sought</l>
                    <l>By prayer the offended Deity to appease;</l>
                    <l>Kneeled, and before him humbled all my heart;</l>
                    <l>Methought I saw him placable and mild,</l>
                    <l>Bending his ear; persuasion in me grew</l>
                    <l>That I was heard with favour; peace returned</l>
                    <l>Home to my breast, and to my memory</l>
                    <l>His promise, that thy seed shall bruise our foe;</l>
                    <l>Which, then not minded in dismay, yet now</l>
                    <l>Assures me that the bitterness of death</l>
                    <l>Is past, and we shall live. Whence hail to thee,</l>
                    <l>Eve rightly called, mother of all mankind,</l>
                    <l>Mother of all things living, since by thee</l>
                    <l>Man is to live; and all things live for Man.</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek.</l>
                    <l>Ill-worthy I such title should belong</l>
                    <l>To me transgressour; who, for thee ordained</l>
                    <l>A help, became thy snare; to me reproach</l>
                    <l>Rather belongs, distrust, and all dispraise:</l>
                    <l>But infinite in pardon was my Judge,</l>
                    <l>That I, who first brought death on all, am graced</l>
                    <l>The source of life; next favourable thou,</l>
                    <l>Who highly thus to entitle me vouchsaf’st,</l>
                    <l>Far other name deserving. But the field</l>
                    <l>To labour calls us, now with sweat imposed,</l>
                    <l>Though after sleepless night; for see! the morn,</l>
                    <l>All unconcerned with our unrest, begins</l>
                    <l>Her rosy progress smiling: let us forth;</l>
                    <l>I never from thy side henceforth to stray,</l>
                    <l>Where’er our day’s work lies, though now enjoined</l>
                    <l>Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,</l>
                    <l>What can be toilsome in these pleasant walks?</l>
                    <l>Here let us live, though in fallen state, content.</l>
                    <l>So spake, so wished much humbled Eve; but Fate</l>
                    <l>Subscribed not: Nature first gave signs, impressed</l>
                    <l>On bird, beast, air; air suddenly eclipsed,</l>
                    <l>After short blush of morn; nigh in her sight</l>
                    <l>The bird of Jove, stooped from his aery tour,</l>
                    <l>Two birds of gayest plume before him drove;</l>
                    <l>Down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods,</l>
                    <l>First hunter then, pursued a gentle brace,</l>
                    <l>Goodliest of all the forest, hart and hind;</l>
                    <l>Direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight.</l>
                    <l>Adam observed, and with his eye the chase</l>
                    <l>Pursuing, not unmoved, to Eve thus spake.</l>
                    <l>O Eve, some further change awaits us nigh,</l>
                    <l>Which Heaven, by these mute signs in Nature, shows</l>
                    <l>Forerunners of his purpose; or to warn</l>
                    <l>Us, haply too secure, of our discharge</l>
                    <l>From penalty, because from death released</l>
                    <l>Some days: how long, and what till then our life,</l>
                    <l>Who knows? or more than this, that we are dust,</l>
                    <l>And thither must return, and be no more?</l>
                    <l>Why else this double object in our sight</l>
                    <l>Of flight pursued in the air, and o’er the ground,</l>
                    <l>One way the self-same hour? why in the east</l>
                    <l>Darkness ere day’s mid-course, and morning-light</l>
                    <l>More orient in yon western cloud, that draws</l>
                    <l>O’er the blue firmament a radiant white,</l>
                    <l>And slow descends with something heavenly fraught?</l>
                    <l>He erred not; for by this the heavenly bands</l>
                    <l>Down from a sky of jasper lighted now</l>
                    <l>In Paradise, and on a hill made halt;</l>
                    <l>A glorious apparition, had not doubt</l>
                    <l>And carnal fear that day dimmed Adam’s eye.</l>
                    <l>Not that more glorious, when the Angels met</l>
                    <l>Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw</l>
                    <l>The field pavilioned with his guardians bright;</l>
                    <l>Nor that, which on the flaming mount appeared</l>
                    <l>In Dothan, covered with a camp of fire,</l>
                    <l>Against the Syrian king, who to surprise</l>
                    <l>One man, assassin-like, had levied war,</l>
                    <l>War unproclaimed. The princely Hierarch</l>
                    <l>In their bright stand there left his Powers, to seise</l>
                    <l>Possession of the garden; he alone,</l>
                    <l>To find where Adam sheltered, took his way,</l>
                    <l>Not unperceived of Adam; who to Eve,</l>
                    <l>While the great visitant approached, thus spake.</l>
                    <l>Eve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps</l>
                    <l>Of us will soon determine, or impose</l>
                    <l>New laws to be observed; for I descry,</l>
                    <l>From yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill,</l>
                    <l>One of the heavenly host; and, by his gait,</l>
                    <l>None of the meanest; some great Potentate</l>
                    <l>Or of the Thrones above; such majesty</l>
                    <l>Invests him coming! yet not terrible,</l>
                    <l>That I should fear; nor sociably mild,</l>
                    <l>As Raphael, that I should much confide;</l>
                    <l>But solemn and sublime; whom not to offend,</l>
                    <l>With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.</l>
                    <l>He ended: and the Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,</l>
                    <l>Not in his shape celestial, but as man</l>
                    <l>Clad to meet man; over his lucid arms</l>
                    <l>A military vest of purple flowed,</l>
                    <l>Livelier than Meliboean, or the grain</l>
                    <l>Of Sarra, worn by kings and heroes old</l>
                    <l>In time of truce; Iris had dipt the woof;</l>
                    <l>His starry helm unbuckled showed him prime</l>
                    <l>In manhood where youth ended; by his side,</l>
                    <l>As in a glistering zodiack, hung the sword,</l>
                    <l>Satan’s dire dread; and in his hand the spear.</l>
                    <l>Adam bowed low; he, kingly, from his state</l>
                    <l>Inclined not, but his coming thus declared.</l>
                    <l>Adam, Heaven’s high behest no preface needs:</l>
                    <l>Sufficient that thy prayers are heard; and Death,</l>
                    <l>Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,</l>
                    <l>Defeated of his seisure many days</l>
                    <l>Given thee of grace; wherein thou mayest repent,</l>
                    <l>And one bad act with many deeds well done</l>
                    <l>Mayest cover: Well may then thy Lord, appeased,</l>
                    <l>Redeem thee quite from Death’s rapacious claim;</l>
                    <l>But longer in this Paradise to dwell</l>
                    <l>Permits not: to remove thee I am come,</l>
                    <l>And send thee from the garden forth to till</l>
                    <l>The ground whence thou wast taken, fitter soil.</l>
                    <l>He added not; for Adam at the news</l>
                    <l>Heart-struck with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,</l>
                    <l>That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen</l>
                    <l>Yet all had heard, with audible lament</l>
                    <l>Discovered soon the place of her retire.</l>
                    <l>O unexpected stroke, worse than of Death!</l>
                    <l>Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave</l>
                    <l>Thee, native soil! these happy walks and shades,</l>
                    <l>Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,</l>
                    <l>Quiet though sad, the respite of that day</l>
                    <l>That must be mortal to us both. O flowers,</l>
                    <l>That never will in other climate grow,</l>
                    <l>My early visitation, and my last</l>
                    <l>At even, which I bred up with tender hand</l>
                    <l>From the first opening bud, and gave ye names,</l>
                    <l>Who now shall rear ye to the sun, or rank</l>
                    <l>Your tribes, and water from the ambrosial fount?</l>
                    <l>Thee lastly, nuptial bower! by me adorned</l>
                    <l>With what to sight or smell was sweet! from thee</l>
                    <l>How shall I part, and whither wander down</l>
                    <l>Into a lower world; to this obscure</l>
                    <l>And wild, how shall we breathe in other air</l>
                    <l>Less pure, accustomed to immortal fruits?</l>
                    <l>Whom thus the Angel interrupted mild.</l>
                    <l>Lament not, Eve, but patiently resign</l>
                    <l>What justly thou hast lost, nor set thy heart,</l>
                    <l>Thus over-fond, on that which is not thine:</l>
                    <l>Thy going is not lonely; with thee goes</l>
                    <l>Thy husband; whom to follow thou art bound;</l>
                    <l>Where he abides, think there thy native soil.</l>
                    <l>Adam, by this from the cold sudden damp</l>
                    <l>Recovering, and his scattered spirits returned,</l>
                    <l>To Michael thus his humble words addressed.</l>
                    <l>Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or named</l>
                    <l>Of them the highest; for such of shape may seem</l>
                    <l>Prince above princes! gently hast thou told</l>
                    <l>Thy message, which might else in telling wound,</l>
                    <l>And in performing end us; what besides</l>
                    <l>Of sorrow, and dejection, and despair,</l>
                    <l>Our frailty can sustain, thy tidings bring,</l>
                    <l>Departure from this happy place, our sweet</l>
                    <l>Recess, and only consolation left</l>
                    <l>Familiar to our eyes! all places else</l>
                    <l>Inhospitable appear, and desolate;</l>
                    <l>Nor knowing us, nor known: And, if by prayer</l>
                    <l>Incessant I could hope to change the will</l>
                    <l>Of Him who all things can, I would not cease</l>
                    <l>To weary him with my assiduous cries:</l>
                    <l>But prayer against his absolute decree</l>
                    <l>No more avails than breath against the wind,</l>
                    <l>Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth:</l>
                    <l>Therefore to his great bidding I submit.</l>
                    <l>This most afflicts me, that, departing hence,</l>
                    <l>As from his face I shall be hid, deprived</l>
                    <l>His blessed countenance: Here I could frequent</l>
                    <l>With worship place by place where he vouchsafed</l>
                    <l>Presence Divine; and to my sons relate,</l>
                    <l>On this mount he appeared; under this tree</l>
                    <l>Stood visible; among these pines his voice</l>
                    <l>I heard; here with him at this fountain talked:</l>
                    <l>So many grateful altars I would rear</l>
                    <l>Of grassy turf, and pile up every stone</l>
                    <l>Of lustre from the brook, in memory,</l>
                    <l>Or monument to ages; and theron</l>
                    <l>Offer sweet-smelling gums, and fruits, and flowers:</l>
                    <l>In yonder nether world where shall I seek</l>
                    <l>His bright appearances, or foot-step trace?</l>
                    <l>For though I fled him angry, yet recalled</l>
                    <l>To life prolonged and promised race, I now</l>
                    <l>Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts</l>
                    <l>Of glory; and far off his steps adore.</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Michael with regard benign.</l>
                    <l>Adam, thou knowest Heaven his, and all the Earth;</l>
                    <l>Not this rock only; his Omnipresence fills</l>
                    <l>Land, sea, and air, and every kind that lives,</l>
                    <l>Fomented by his virtual power and warmed:</l>
                    <l>All the earth he gave thee to possess and rule,</l>
                    <l>No despicable gift; surmise not then</l>
                    <l>His presence to these narrow bounds confined</l>
                    <l>Of Paradise, or Eden: this had been</l>
                    <l>Perhaps thy capital seat, from whence had spread</l>
                    <l>All generations; and had hither come</l>
                    <l>From all the ends of the earth, to celebrate</l>
                    <l>And reverence thee, their great progenitor.</l>
                    <l>But this pre-eminence thou hast lost, brought down</l>
                    <l>To dwell on even ground now with thy sons:</l>
                    <l>Yet doubt not but in valley, and in plain,</l>
                    <l>God is, as here; and will be found alike</l>
                    <l>Present; and of his presence many a sign</l>
                    <l>Still following thee, still compassing thee round</l>
                    <l>With goodness and paternal love, his face</l>
                    <l>Express, and of his steps the track divine.</l>
                    <l>Which that thou mayest believe, and be confirmed</l>
                    <l>Ere thou from hence depart; know, I am sent</l>
                    <l>To show thee what shall come in future days</l>
                    <l>To thee, and to thy offspring: good with bad</l>
                    <l>Expect to hear; supernal grace contending</l>
                    <l>With sinfulness of men; thereby to learn</l>
                    <l>True patience, and to temper joy with fear</l>
                    <l>And pious sorrow; equally inured</l>
                    <l>By moderation either state to bear,</l>
                    <l>Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead</l>
                    <l>Safest thy life, and best prepared endure</l>
                    <l>Thy mortal passage when it comes.—Ascend</l>
                    <l>This hill; let Eve (for I have drenched her eyes)</l>
                    <l>Here sleep below; while thou to foresight wakest;</l>
                    <l>As once thou sleptst, while she to life was formed.</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Adam gratefully replied.</l>
                    <l>Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path</l>
                    <l>Thou leadest me; and to the hand of Heaven submit,</l>
                    <l>However chastening; to the evil turn</l>
                    <l>My obvious breast; arming to overcome</l>
                    <l>By suffering, and earn rest from labour won,</l>
                    <l>If so I may attain.—So both ascend</l>
                    <l>In the visions of God. It was a hill,</l>
                    <l>Of Paradise the highest; from whose top</l>
                    <l>The hemisphere of earth, in clearest ken,</l>
                    <l>Stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay.</l>
                    <l>Not higher that hill, nor wider looking round,</l>
                    <l>Whereon, for different cause, the Tempter set</l>
                    <l>Our second Adam, in the wilderness;</l>
                    <l>To show him all Earth’s kingdoms, and their glory.</l>
                    <l>His eye might there command wherever stood</l>
                    <l>City of old or modern fame, the seat</l>
                    <l>Of mightiest empire, from the destined walls</l>
                    <l>Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can,</l>
                    <l>And Samarchand by Oxus, Temir’s throne,</l>
                    <l>To Paquin of Sinaean kings; and thence</l>
                    <l>To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul,</l>
                    <l>Down to the golden Chersonese; or where</l>
                    <l>The Persian in Ecbatan sat, or since</l>
                    <l>In Hispahan; or where the Russian Ksar</l>
                    <l>In Mosco; or the Sultan in Bizance,</l>
                    <l>Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken</l>
                    <l>The empire of Negus to his utmost port</l>
                    <l>Ercoco, and the less maritim kings</l>
                    <l>Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind,</l>
                    <l>And Sofala, thought Ophir, to the realm</l>
                    <l>Of Congo, and Angola farthest south;</l>
                    <l>Or thence from Niger flood to Atlas mount</l>
                    <l>The kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and Sus,</l>
                    <l>Morocco, and Algiers, and Tremisen;</l>
                    <l>On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway</l>
                    <l>The world: in spirit perhaps he also saw</l>
                    <l>Rich Mexico, the seat of Montezume,</l>
                    <l>And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat</l>
                    <l>Of Atabalipa; and yet unspoiled</l>
                    <l>Guiana, whose great city Geryon’s sons</l>
                    <l>Call El Dorado. But to nobler sights</l>
                    <l>Michael from Adam’s eyes the film removed,</l>
                    <l>Which that false fruit that promised clearer sight</l>
                    <l>Had bred; then purged with euphrasy and rue</l>
                    <l>The visual nerve, for he had much to see;</l>
                    <l>And from the well of life three drops instilled.</l>
                    <l>So deep the power of these ingredients pierced,</l>
                    <l>Even to the inmost seat of mental sight,</l>
                    <l>That Adam, now enforced to close his eyes,</l>
                    <l>Sunk down, and all his spirits became entranced;</l>
                    <l>But him the gentle Angel by the hand</l>
                    <l>Soon raised, and his attention thus recalled.</l>
                    <l>Adam, now ope thine eyes; and first behold</l>
                    <l>The effects, which thy original crime hath wrought</l>
                    <l>In some to spring from thee; who never touched</l>
                    <l>The excepted tree; nor with the snake conspired;</l>
                    <l>Nor sinned thy sin; yet from that sin derive</l>
                    <l>Corruption, to bring forth more violent deeds.</l>
                    <l>His eyes he opened, and beheld a field,</l>
                    <l>Part arable and tilth, whereon were sheaves</l>
                    <l>New reaped; the other part sheep-walks and folds;</l>
                    <l>I’ the midst an altar as the land-mark stood,</l>
                    <l>Rustick, of grassy sord; thither anon</l>
                    <l>A sweaty reaper from his tillage brought</l>
                    <l>First fruits, the green ear, and the yellow sheaf,</l>
                    <l>Unculled, as came to hand; a shepherd next,</l>
                    <l>More meek, came with the firstlings of his flock,</l>
                    <l>Choicest and best; then, sacrificing, laid</l>
                    <l>The inwards and their fat, with incense strowed,</l>
                    <l>On the cleft wood, and all due rights performed:</l>
                    <l>His offering soon propitious fire from Heaven</l>
                    <l>Consumed with nimble glance, and grateful steam;</l>
                    <l>The other’s not, for his was not sincere;</l>
                    <l>Whereat he inly raged, and, as they talked,</l>
                    <l>Smote him into the midriff with a stone</l>
                    <l>That beat out life; he fell; and, deadly pale,</l>
                    <l>Groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused.</l>
                    <l>Much at that sight was Adam in his heart</l>
                    <l>Dismayed, and thus in haste to the Angel cried.</l>
                    <l>O Teacher, some great mischief hath befallen</l>
                    <l>To that meek man, who well had sacrificed;</l>
                    <l>Is piety thus and pure devotion paid?</l>
                    <l>To whom Michael thus, he also moved, replied.</l>
                    <l>These two are brethren, Adam, and to come</l>
                    <l>Out of thy loins; the unjust the just hath slain,</l>
                    <l>For envy that his brother’s offering found</l>
                    <l>From Heaven acceptance; but the bloody fact</l>
                    <l>Will be avenged; and the other’s faith, approved,</l>
                    <l>Lose no reward; though here thou see him die,</l>
                    <l>Rolling in dust and gore. To which our sire.</l>
                    <l>Alas! both for the deed, and for the cause!</l>
                    <l>But have I now seen Death? Is this the way</l>
                    <l>I must return to native dust? O sight</l>
                    <l>Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold,</l>
                    <l>Horrid to think, how horrible to feel!</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen</l>
                    <l>In his first shape on Man; but many shapes</l>
                    <l>Of Death, and many are the ways that lead</l>
                    <l>To his grim cave, all dismal; yet to sense</l>
                    <l>More terrible at the entrance, than within.</l>
                    <l>Some, as thou sawest, by violent stroke shall die;</l>
                    <l>By fire, flood, famine, by intemperance more</l>
                    <l>In meats and drinks, which on the earth shall bring</l>
                    <l>Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew</l>
                    <l>Before thee shall appear; that thou mayest know</l>
                    <l>What misery the inabstinence of Eve</l>
                    <l>Shall bring on Men. Immediately a place</l>
                    <l>Before his eyes appeared, sad, noisome, dark;</l>
                    <l>A lazar-house it seemed; wherein were laid</l>
                    <l>Numbers of all diseased; all maladies</l>
                    <l>Of ghastly spasm, or racking torture, qualms</l>
                    <l>Of heart-sick agony, all feverous kinds,</l>
                    <l>Convulsions, epilepsies, fierce catarrhs,</l>
                    <l>Intestine stone and ulcer, colick-pangs,</l>
                    <l>Demoniack phrenzy, moaping melancholy,</l>
                    <l>And moon-struck madness, pining atrophy,</l>
                    <l>Marasmus, and wide-wasting pestilence,</l>
                    <l>Dropsies, and asthmas, and joint-racking rheums.</l>
                    <l>Dire was the tossing, deep the groans; Despair</l>
                    <l>Tended the sick busiest from couch to couch;</l>
                    <l>And over them triumphant Death his dart</l>
                    <l>Shook, but delayed to strike, though oft invoked</l>
                    <l>With vows, as their chief good, and final hope.</l>
                    <l>Sight so deform what heart of rock could long</l>
                    <l>Dry-eyed behold? Adam could not, but wept,</l>
                    <l>Though not of woman born; compassion quelled</l>
                    <l>His best of man, and gave him up to tears</l>
                    <l>A space, till firmer thoughts restrained excess;</l>
                    <l>And, scarce recovering words, his plaint renewed.</l>
                    <l>O miserable mankind, to what fall</l>
                    <l>Degraded, to what wretched state reserved!</l>
                    <l>Better end here unborn. Why is life given</l>
                    <l>To be thus wrested from us? rather, why</l>
                    <l>Obtruded on us thus? who, if we knew</l>
                    <l>What we receive, would either not accept</l>
                    <l>Life offered, or soon beg to lay it down;</l>
                    <l>Glad to be so dismissed in peace. Can thus</l>
                    <l>The image of God in Man, created once</l>
                    <l>So goodly and erect, though faulty since,</l>
                    <l>To such unsightly sufferings be debased</l>
                    <l>Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man,</l>
                    <l>Retaining still divine similitude</l>
                    <l>In part, from such deformities be free,</l>
                    <l>And, for his Maker’s image sake, exempt?</l>
                    <l>Their Maker’s image, answered Michael, then</l>
                    <l>Forsook them, when themselves they vilified</l>
                    <l>To serve ungoverned Appetite; and took</l>
                    <l>His image whom they served, a brutish vice,</l>
                    <l>Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve.</l>
                    <l>Therefore so abject is their punishment,</l>
                    <l>Disfiguring not God’s likeness, but their own;</l>
                    <l>Or if his likeness, by themselves defaced;</l>
                    <l>While they pervert pure Nature’s healthful rules</l>
                    <l>To loathsome sickness; worthily, since they</l>
                    <l>God’s image did not reverence in themselves.</l>
                    <l>I yield it just, said Adam, and submit.</l>
                    <l>But is there yet no other way, besides</l>
                    <l>These painful passages, how we may come</l>
                    <l>To death, and mix with our connatural dust?</l>
                    <l>There is, said Michael, if thou well observe</l>
                    <l>The rule of Not too much; by temperance taught,</l>
                    <l>In what thou eatest and drinkest; seeking from thence</l>
                    <l>Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,</l>
                    <l>Till many years over thy head return:</l>
                    <l>So mayest thou live; till, like ripe fruit, thou drop</l>
                    <l>Into thy mother’s lap; or be with ease</l>
                    <l>Gathered, nor harshly plucked; for death mature:</l>
                    <l>This is Old Age; but then, thou must outlive</l>
                    <l>Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty; which will change</l>
                    <l>To withered, weak, and gray; thy senses then,</l>
                    <l>Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forego,</l>
                    <l>To what thou hast; and, for the air of youth,</l>
                    <l>Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reign</l>
                    <l>A melancholy damp of cold and dry</l>
                    <l>To weigh thy spirits down, and last consume</l>
                    <l>The balm of life. To whom our ancestor.</l>
                    <l>Henceforth I fly not death, nor would prolong</l>
                    <l>Life much; bent rather, how I may be quit,</l>
                    <l>Fairest and easiest, of this cumbrous charge;</l>
                    <l>Which I must keep till my appointed day</l>
                    <l>Of rendering up, and patiently attend</l>
                    <l>My dissolution. Michael replied.</l>
                    <l>Nor love thy life, nor hate; but what thou livest</l>
                    <l>Live well; how long, or short, permit to Heaven:</l>
                    <l>And now prepare thee for another sight.</l>
                    <l>He looked, and saw a spacious plain, whereon</l>
                    <l>Were tents of various hue; by some, were herds</l>
                    <l>Of cattle grazing; others, whence the sound</l>
                    <l>Of instruments, that made melodious chime,</l>
                    <l>Was heard, of harp and organ; and, who moved</l>
                    <l>Their stops and chords, was seen; his volant touch,</l>
                    <l>Instinct through all proportions, low and high,</l>
                    <l>Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue.</l>
                    <l>In other part stood one who, at the forge</l>
                    <l>Labouring, two massy clods of iron and brass</l>
                    <l>Had melted, (whether found where casual fire</l>
                    <l>Had wasted woods on mountain or in vale,</l>
                    <l>Down to the veins of earth; thence gliding hot</l>
                    <l>To some cave’s mouth; or whether washed by stream</l>
                    <l>From underground;) the liquid ore he drained</l>
                    <l>Into fit moulds prepared; from which he formed</l>
                    <l>First his own tools; then, what might else be wrought</l>
                    <l>Fusil or graven in metal. After these,</l>
                    <l>But on the hither side, a different sort</l>
                    <l>From the high neighbouring hills, which was their seat,</l>
                    <l>Down to the plain descended; by their guise</l>
                    <l>Just men they seemed, and all their study bent</l>
                    <l>To worship God aright, and know his works</l>
                    <l>Not hid; nor those things last, which might preserve</l>
                    <l>Freedom and peace to Men; they on the plain</l>
                    <l>Long had not walked, when from the tents, behold!</l>
                    <l>A bevy of fair women, richly gay</l>
                    <l>In gems and wanton dress; to the harp they sung</l>
                    <l>Soft amorous ditties, and in dance came on:</l>
                    <l>The men, though grave, eyed them; and let their eyes</l>
                    <l>Rove without rein; till, in the amorous net</l>
                    <l>Fast caught, they liked; and each his liking chose;</l>
                    <l>And now of love they treat, till the evening-star,</l>
                    <l>Love’s harbinger, appeared; then, all in heat</l>
                    <l>They light the nuptial torch, and bid invoke</l>
                    <l>Hymen, then first to marriage rites invoked:</l>
                    <l>With feast and musick all the tents resound.</l>
                    <l>Such happy interview, and fair event</l>
                    <l>Of love and youth not lost, songs, garlands, flowers,</l>
                    <l>And charming symphonies, attached the heart</l>
                    <l>Of Adam, soon inclined to admit delight,</l>
                    <l>The bent of nature; which he thus expressed.</l>
                    <l>True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest;</l>
                    <l>Much better seems this vision, and more hope</l>
                    <l>Of peaceful days portends, than those two past;</l>
                    <l>Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse;</l>
                    <l>Here Nature seems fulfilled in all her ends.</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Michael. Judge not what is best</l>
                    <l>By pleasure, though to nature seeming meet;</l>
                    <l>Created, as thou art, to nobler end</l>
                    <l>Holy and pure, conformity divine.</l>
                    <l>Those tents thou sawest so pleasant, were the tents</l>
                    <l>Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his race</l>
                    <l>Who slew his brother; studious they appear</l>
                    <l>Of arts that polish life, inventers rare;</l>
                    <l>Unmindful of their Maker, though his Spirit</l>
                    <l>Taught them; but they his gifts acknowledged none.</l>
                    <l>Yet they a beauteous offspring shall beget;</l>
                    <l>For that fair female troop thou sawest, that seemed</l>
                    <l>Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,</l>
                    <l>Yet empty of all good wherein consists</l>
                    <l>Woman’s domestick honour and chief praise;</l>
                    <l>Bred only and completed to the taste</l>
                    <l>Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance,</l>
                    <l>To dress, and troll the tongue, and roll the eye:</l>
                    <l>To these that sober race of men, whose lives</l>
                    <l>Religious titled them the sons of God,</l>
                    <l>Shall yield up all their virtue, all their fame</l>
                    <l>Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles</l>
                    <l>Of these fair atheists; and now swim in joy,</l>
                    <l>Erelong to swim at large; and laugh, for which</l>
                    <l>The world erelong a world of tears must weep.</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Adam, of short joy bereft.</l>
                    <l>O pity and shame, that they, who to live well</l>
                    <l>Entered so fair, should turn aside to tread</l>
                    <l>Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint!</l>
                    <l>But still I see the tenour of Man’s woe</l>
                    <l>Holds on the same, from Woman to begin.</l>
                    <l>From Man’s effeminate slackness it begins,</l>
                    <l>Said the Angel, who should better hold his place</l>
                    <l>By wisdom, and superiour gifts received.</l>
                    <l>But now prepare thee for another scene.</l>
                    <l>He looked, and saw wide territory spread</l>
                    <l>Before him, towns, and rural works between;</l>
                    <l>Cities of men with lofty gates and towers,</l>
                    <l>Concourse in arms, fierce faces threatening war,</l>
                    <l>Giants of mighty bone and bold emprise;</l>
                    <l>Part wield their arms, part curb the foaming steed,</l>
                    <l>Single or in array of battle ranged</l>
                    <l>Both horse and foot, nor idly mustering stood;</l>
                    <l>One way a band select from forage drives</l>
                    <l>A herd of beeves, fair oxen and fair kine,</l>
                    <l>From a fat meadow ground; or fleecy flock,</l>
                    <l>Ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain,</l>
                    <l>Their booty; scarce with life the shepherds fly,</l>
                    <l>But call in aid, which makes a bloody fray;</l>
                    <l>With cruel tournament the squadrons join;</l>
                    <l>Where cattle pastured late, now scattered lies</l>
                    <l>With carcasses and arms the ensanguined field,</l>
                    <l>Deserted: Others to a city strong</l>
                    <l>Lay siege, encamped; by battery, scale, and mine,</l>
                    <l>Assaulting; others from the wall defend</l>
                    <l>With dart and javelin, stones, and sulphurous fire;</l>
                    <l>On each hand slaughter, and gigantick deeds.</l>
                    <l>In other part the sceptered heralds call</l>
                    <l>To council, in the city-gates; anon</l>
                    <l>Gray-headed men and grave, with warriours mixed,</l>
                    <l>Assemble, and harangues are heard; but soon,</l>
                    <l>In factious opposition; till at last,</l>
                    <l>Of middle age one rising, eminent</l>
                    <l>In wise deport, spake much of right and wrong,</l>
                    <l>Of justice, or religion, truth, and peace,</l>
                    <l>And judgement from above: him old and young</l>
                    <l>Exploded, and had seized with violent hands,</l>
                    <l>Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence</l>
                    <l>Unseen amid the throng: so violence</l>
                    <l>Proceeded, and oppression, and sword-law,</l>
                    <l>Through all the plain, and refuge none was found.</l>
                    <l>Adam was all in tears, and to his guide</l>
                    <l>Lamenting turned full sad; O! what are these,</l>
                    <l>Death’s ministers, not men? who thus deal death</l>
                    <l>Inhumanly to men, and multiply</l>
                    <l>Ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew</l>
                    <l>His brother: for of whom such massacre</l>
                    <l>Make they, but of their brethren; men of men</l>
                    <l>But who was that just man, whom had not Heaven</l>
                    <l>Rescued, had in his righteousness been lost?</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Michael. These are the product</l>
                    <l>Of those ill-mated marriages thou sawest;</l>
                    <l>Where good with bad were matched, who of themselves</l>
                    <l>Abhor to join; and, by imprudence mixed,</l>
                    <l>Produce prodigious births of body or mind.</l>
                    <l>Such were these giants, men of high renown;</l>
                    <l>For in those days might only shall be admired,</l>
                    <l>And valour and heroick virtue called;</l>
                    <l>To overcome in battle, and subdue</l>
                    <l>Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite</l>
                    <l>Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch</l>
                    <l>Of human glory; and for glory done</l>
                    <l>Of triumph, to be styled great conquerours</l>
                    <l>Patrons of mankind, Gods, and sons of Gods;</l>
                    <l>Destroyers rightlier called, and plagues of men.</l>
                    <l>Thus fame shall be achieved, renown on earth;</l>
                    <l>And what most merits fame, in silence hid.</l>
                    <l>But he, the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst</l>
                    <l>The only righteous in a world preverse,</l>
                    <l>And therefore hated, therefore so beset</l>
                    <l>With foes, for daring single to be just,</l>
                    <l>And utter odious truth, that God would come</l>
                    <l>To judge them with his Saints; him the Most High</l>
                    <l>Rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds</l>
                    <l>Did, as thou sawest, receive, to walk with God</l>
                    <l>High in salvation and the climes of bliss,</l>
                    <l>Exempt from death; to show thee what reward</l>
                    <l>Awaits the good; the rest what punishment;</l>
                    <l>Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.</l>
                    <l>He looked, and saw the face of things quite changed;</l>
                    <l>The brazen throat of war had ceased to roar;</l>
                    <l>All now was turned to jollity and game,</l>
                    <l>To luxury and riot, feast and dance;</l>
                    <l>Marrying or prostituting, as befel,</l>
                    <l>Rape or adultery, where passing fair</l>
                    <l>Allured them; thence from cups to civil broils.</l>
                    <l>At length a reverend sire among them came,</l>
                    <l>And of their doings great dislike declared,</l>
                    <l>And testified against their ways; he oft</l>
                    <l>Frequented their assemblies, whereso met,</l>
                    <l>Triumphs or festivals; and to them preached</l>
                    <l>Conversion and repentance, as to souls</l>
                    <l>In prison, under judgements imminent:</l>
                    <l>But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceased</l>
                    <l>Contending, and removed his tents far off;</l>
                    <l>Then, from the mountain hewing timber tall,</l>
                    <l>Began to build a vessel of huge bulk;</l>
                    <l>Measured by cubit, length, and breadth, and highth;</l>
                    <l>Smeared round with pitch; and in the side a door</l>
                    <l>Contrived; and of provisions laid in large,</l>
                    <l>For man and beast: when lo, a wonder strange!</l>
                    <l>Of every beast, and bird, and insect small,</l>
                    <l>Came sevens, and pairs; and entered in as taught</l>
                    <l>Their order: last the sire and his three sons,</l>
                    <l>With their four wives; and God made fast the door.</l>
                    <l>Mean while the south-wind rose, and, with black wings</l>
                    <l>Wide-hovering, all the clouds together drove</l>
                    <l>From under Heaven; the hills to their supply</l>
                    <l>Vapour, and exhalation dusk and moist,</l>
                    <l>Sent up amain; and now the thickened sky</l>
                    <l>Like a dark ceiling stood; down rushed the rain</l>
                    <l>Impetuous; and continued, till the earth</l>
                    <l>No more was seen: the floating vessel swum</l>
                    <l>Uplifted, and secure with beaked prow</l>
                    <l>Rode tilting o’er the waves; all dwellings else</l>
                    <l>Flood overwhelmed, and them with all their pomp</l>
                    <l>Deep under water rolled; sea covered sea,</l>
                    <l>Sea without shore; and in their palaces,</l>
                    <l>Where luxury late reigned, sea-monsters whelped</l>
                    <l>And stabled; of mankind, so numerous late,</l>
                    <l>All left, in one small bottom swum imbarked.</l>
                    <l>How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold</l>
                    <l>The end of all thy offspring, end so sad,</l>
                    <l>Depopulation! Thee another flood,</l>
                    <l>Of tears and sorrow a flood, thee also drowned,</l>
                    <l>And sunk thee as thy sons; till, gently reared</l>
                    <l>By the Angel, on thy feet thou stoodest at last,</l>
                    <l>Though comfortless; as when a father mourns</l>
                    <l>His children, all in view destroyed at once;</l>
                    <l>And scarce to the Angel utter’dst thus thy plaint.</l>
                    <l>O visions ill foreseen! Better had I</l>
                    <l>Lived ignorant of future! so had borne</l>
                    <l>My part of evil only, each day’s lot</l>
                    <l>Enough to bear; those now, that were dispensed</l>
                    <l>The burden of many ages, on me light</l>
                    <l>At once, by my foreknowledge gaining birth</l>
                    <l>Abortive, to torment me ere their being,</l>
                    <l>With thought that they must be. Let no man seek</l>
                    <l>Henceforth to be foretold, what shall befall</l>
                    <l>Him or his children; evil he may be sure,</l>
                    <l>Which neither his foreknowing can prevent;</l>
                    <l>And he the future evil shall no less</l>
                    <l>In apprehension than in substance feel,</l>
                    <l>Grievous to bear: but that care now is past,</l>
                    <l>Man is not whom to warn: those few escaped</l>
                    <l>Famine and anguish will at last consume,</l>
                    <l>Wandering that watery desart: I had hope,</l>
                    <l>When violence was ceased, and war on earth,</l>
                    <l>All would have then gone well; peace would have crowned</l>
                    <l>With length of happy days the race of Man;</l>
                    <l>But I was far deceived; for now I see</l>
                    <l>Peace to corrupt no less than war to waste.</l>
                    <l>How comes it thus? unfold, celestial Guide,</l>
                    <l>And whether here the race of Man will end.</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Michael. Those, whom last thou sawest</l>
                    <l>In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they</l>
                    <l>First seen in acts of prowess eminent</l>
                    <l>And great exploits, but of true virtue void;</l>
                    <l>Who, having spilt much blood, and done much wast</l>
                    <l>Subduing nations, and achieved thereby</l>
                    <l>Fame in the world, high titles, and rich prey;</l>
                    <l>Shall change their course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,</l>
                    <l>Surfeit, and lust; till wantonness and pride</l>
                    <l>Raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace.</l>
                    <l>The conquered also, and enslaved by war,</l>
                    <l>Shall, with their freedom lost, all virtue lose</l>
                    <l>And fear of God; from whom their piety feigned</l>
                    <l>In sharp contest of battle found no aid</l>
                    <l>Against invaders; therefore, cooled in zeal,</l>
                    <l>Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure,</l>
                    <l>Worldly or dissolute, on what their lords</l>
                    <l>Shall leave them to enjoy; for the earth shall bear</l>
                    <l>More than enough, that temperance may be tried:</l>
                    <l>So all shall turn degenerate, all depraved;</l>
                    <l>Justice and temperance, truth and faith, forgot;</l>
                    <l>One man except, the only son of light</l>
                    <l>In a dark age, against example good,</l>
                    <l>Against allurement, custom, and a world</l>
                    <l>Offended: fearless of reproach and scorn,</l>
                    <l>Or violence, he of their wicked ways</l>
                    <l>Shall them admonish; and before them set</l>
                    <l>The paths of righteousness, how much more safe</l>
                    <l>And full of peace; denouncing wrath to come</l>
                    <l>On their impenitence; and shall return</l>
                    <l>Of them derided, but of God observed</l>
                    <l>The one just man alive; by his command</l>
                    <l>Shall build a wonderous ark, as thou beheldst,</l>
                    <l>To save himself, and houshold, from amidst</l>
                    <l>A world devote to universal wrack.</l>
                    <l>No sooner he, with them of man and beast</l>
                    <l>Select for life, shall in the ark be lodged,</l>
                    <l>And sheltered round; but all the cataracts</l>
                    <l>Of Heaven set open on the Earth shall pour</l>
                    <l>Rain, day and night; all fountains of the deep,</l>
                    <l>Broke up, shall heave the ocean to usurp</l>
                    <l>Beyond all bounds; till inundation rise</l>
                    <l>Above the highest hills: Then shall this mount</l>
                    <l>Of Paradise by might of waves be moved</l>
                    <l>Out of his place, pushed by the horned flood,</l>
                    <l>With all his verdure spoiled, and trees adrift,</l>
                    <l>Down the great river to the opening gulf,</l>
                    <l>And there take root an island salt and bare,</l>
                    <l>The haunt of seals, and orcs, and sea-mews’ clang:</l>
                    <l>To teach thee that God attributes to place</l>
                    <l>No sanctity, if none be thither brought</l>
                    <l>By men who there frequent, or therein dwell.</l>
                    <l>And now, what further shall ensue, behold.</l>
                    <l>He looked, and saw the ark hull on the flood,</l>
                    <l>Which now abated; for the clouds were fled,</l>
                    <l>Driven by a keen north-wind, that, blowing dry,</l>
                    <l>Wrinkled the face of deluge, as decayed;</l>
                    <l>And the clear sun on his wide watery glass</l>
                    <l>Gazed hot, and of the fresh wave largely drew,</l>
                    <l>As after thirst; which made their flowing shrink</l>
                    <l>From standing lake to tripping ebb, that stole</l>
                    <l>With soft foot towards the deep; who now had stopt</l>
                    <l>His sluces, as the Heaven his windows shut.</l>
                    <l>The ark no more now floats, but seems on ground,</l>
                    <l>Fast on the top of some high mountain fixed.</l>
                    <l>And now the tops of hills, as rocks, appear;</l>
                    <l>With clamour thence the rapid currents drive,</l>
                    <l>Towards the retreating sea, their furious tide.</l>
                    <l>Forthwith from out the ark a raven flies,</l>
                    <l>And after him, the surer messenger,</l>
                    <l>A dove sent forth once and again to spy</l>
                    <l>Green tree or ground, whereon his foot may light:</l>
                    <l>The second time returning, in his bill</l>
                    <l>An olive-leaf he brings, pacifick sign:</l>
                    <l>Anon dry ground appears, and from his ark</l>
                    <l>The ancient sire descends, with all his train;</l>
                    <l>Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,</l>
                    <l>Grateful to Heaven, over his head beholds</l>
                    <l>A dewy cloud, and in the cloud a bow</l>
                    <l>Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay,</l>
                    <l>Betokening peace from God, and covenant new.</l>
                    <l>Whereat the heart of Adam, erst so sad,</l>
                    <l>Greatly rejoiced; and thus his joy broke forth.</l>
                    <l>O thou, who future things canst represent</l>
                    <l>As present, heavenly Instructer! I revive</l>
                    <l>At this last sight; assured that Man shall live,</l>
                    <l>With all the creatures, and their seed preserve.</l>
                    <l>Far less I now lament for one whole world</l>
                    <l>Of wicked sons destroyed, than I rejoice</l>
                    <l>For one man found so perfect, and so just,</l>
                    <l>That God vouchsafes to raise another world</l>
                    <l>From him, and all his anger to forget.</l>
                    <l>But say, what mean those coloured streaks in Heaven</l>
                    <l>Distended, as the brow of God appeased?</l>
                    <l>Or serve they, as a flowery verge, to bind</l>
                    <l>The fluid skirts of that same watery cloud,</l>
                    <l>Lest it again dissolve, and shower the earth?</l>
                    <l>To whom the Arch-Angel. Dextrously thou aimest;</l>
                    <l>So willingly doth God remit his ire,</l>
                    <l>Though late repenting him of Man depraved;</l>
                    <l>Grieved at his heart, when looking down he saw</l>
                    <l>The whole earth filled with violence, and all flesh</l>
                    <l>Corrupting each their way; yet, those removed,</l>
                    <l>Such grace shall one just man find in his sight,</l>
                    <l>That he relents, not to blot out mankind;</l>
                    <l>And makes a covenant never to destroy</l>
                    <l>The earth again by flood; nor let the sea</l>
                    <l>Surpass his bounds; nor rain to drown the world,</l>
                    <l>With man therein or beast; but, when he brings</l>
                    <l>Over the earth a cloud, will therein set</l>
                    <l>His triple-coloured bow, whereon to look,</l>
                    <l>And call to mind his covenant: Day and night,</l>
                    <l>Seed-time and harvest, heat and hoary frost,</l>
                    <l>Shall hold their course; till fire purge all things new,</l>
                    <l>Both Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.</l>

                    <l>As one who in his journey bates at noon,</l>
                    <l>Though bent on speed; so here the Arch-Angel paused</l>
                    <l>Betwixt the world destroyed and world restored,</l>
                    <l>If Adam aught perhaps might interpose;</l>
                    <l>Then, with transition sweet, new speech resumes.</l>
                    <l>Thus thou hast seen one world begin, and end;</l>
                    <l>And Man, as from a second stock, proceed.</l>
                    <l>Much thou hast yet to see; but I perceive</l>
                    <l>Thy mortal sight to fail; objects divine</l>

                    <l>Henceforth what is to come I will relate;</l>
                    <l>Thou therefore give due audience, and attend.</l>
                    <l>This second source of Men, while yet but few,</l>
                    <l>And while the dread of judgement past remains</l>
                    <l>Fresh in their minds, fearing the Deity,</l>
                    <l>With some regard to what is just and right</l>
                    <l>Shall lead their lives, and multiply apace;</l>
                    <l>Labouring the soil, and reaping plenteous crop,</l>
                    <l>Corn, wine, and oil; and, from the herd or flock,</l>
                    <l>Oft sacrificing bullock, lamb, or kid,</l>
                    <l>With large wine-offerings poured, and sacred feast,</l>
                    <l>Shall spend their days in joy unblamed; and dwell</l>
                    <l>Long time in peace, by families and tribes,</l>

                    <l>With fair equality, fraternal state,</l>
                    <l>Will arrogate dominion undeserved</l>

                    <l>Concord and law of nature from the earth;</l>
                    <l>Hunting (and men not beasts shall be his game)</l>
                    <l>With war, and hostile snare, such as refuse</l>
                    <l>Subjection to his empire tyrannous:</l>
                    <l>A mighty hunter thence he shall be styled</l>
                    <l>Before the Lord; as in despite of Heaven,</l>
                    <l>Or from Heaven, claiming second sovranty;</l>
                    <l>And from rebellion shall derive his name,</l>
                    <l>Though of rebellion others he accuse.</l>
                    <l>He with a crew, whom like ambition joins</l>

                    <l>Marching from Eden towards the west, shall find</l>
                    <l>The plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge</l>
                    <l>Boils out from under ground, the mouth of Hell:</l>
                    <l>Of brick, and of that stuff, they cast to build</l>
                    <l>A city and tower, whose top may reach to Heaven;</l>
                    <l>And get themselves a name; lest, far dispersed</l>
                    <l>In foreign lands, their memory be lost;</l>
                    <l>Regardless whether good or evil fame.</l>
                    <l>But God, who oft descends to visit men</l>
                    <l>Unseen, and through their habitations walks</l>
                    <l>To mark their doings, them beholding soon,</l>
                    <l>Comes down to see their city, ere the tower</l>
                    <l>Obstruct Heaven-towers, and in derision sets</l>
                    <l>Upon their tongues a various spirit, to rase</l>
                    <l>Quite out their native language; and, instead,</l>
                    <l>To sow a jangling noise of words unknown:</l>
                    <l>Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud,</l>
                    <l>Among the builders; each to other calls</l>
                    <l>Not understood; till hoarse, and all in rage,</l>
                    <l>As mocked they storm: great laughter was in Heaven,</l>
                    <l>And looking down, to see the hubbub strange,</l>
                    <l>And hear the din: Thus was the building left</l>
                    <l>Ridiculous, and the work Confusion named.</l>
                    <l>Whereto thus Adam, fatherly displeased.</l>
                    <l>O execrable son! so to aspire</l>
                    <l>Above his brethren; to himself assuming</l>
                    <l>Authority usurped, from God not given:</l>
                    <l>He gave us only over beast, fish, fowl,</l>
                    <l>Dominion absolute; that right we hold</l>
                    <l>By his donation; but man over men</l>
                    <l>He made not lord; such title to himself</l>
                    <l>Reserving, human left from human free.</l>
                    <l>But this usurper his encroachment proud</l>
                    <l>Stays not on Man; to God his tower intends</l>
                    <l>Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food</l>
                    <l>Will he convey up thither, to sustain</l>
                    <l>Himself and his rash army; where thin air</l>
                    <l>Above the clouds will pine his entrails gross,</l>
                    <l>And famish him of breath, if not of bread?</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Michael. Justly thou abhorrest</l>
                    <l>That son, who on the quiet state of men</l>
                    <l>Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue</l>
                    <l>Rational liberty; yet know withal,</l>
                    <l>Since thy original lapse, true liberty</l>
                    <l>Is lost, which always with right reason dwells</l>
                    <l>Twinned, and from her hath no dividual being:</l>
                    <l>Reason in man obscured, or not obeyed,</l>
                    <l>Immediately inordinate desires,</l>
                    <l>And upstart passions, catch the government</l>
                    <l>From reason; and to servitude reduce</l>
                    <l>Man, till then free. Therefore, since he permits</l>
                    <l>Within himself unworthy powers to reign</l>
                    <l>Over free reason, God, in judgement just,</l>
                    <l>Subjects him from without to violent lords;</l>
                    <l>Who oft as undeservedly enthrall</l>
                    <l>His outward freedom: Tyranny must be;</l>
                    <l>Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse.</l>
                    <l>Yet sometimes nations will decline so low</l>
                    <l>From virtue, which is reason, that no wrong,</l>
                    <l>But justice, and some fatal curse annexed,</l>
                    <l>Deprives them of their outward liberty;</l>
                    <l>Their inward lost: Witness the irreverent son</l>
                    <l>Of him who built the ark; who, for the shame</l>
                    <l>Done to his father, heard this heavy curse,</l>
                    <l>Servant of servants, on his vicious race.</l>
                    <l>Thus will this latter, as the former world,</l>
                    <l>Still tend from bad to worse; till God at last,</l>
                    <l>Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw</l>
                    <l>His presence from among them, and avert</l>
                    <l>His holy eyes; resolving from thenceforth</l>
                    <l>To leave them to their own polluted ways;</l>
                    <l>And one peculiar nation to select</l>
                    <l>From all the rest, of whom to be invoked,</l>
                    <l>A nation from one faithful man to spring:</l>
                    <l>Him on this side Euphrates yet residing,</l>
                    <l>Bred up in idol-worship: O, that men</l>
                    <l>(Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,</l>
                    <l>While yet the patriarch lived, who ’scaped the flood,</l>
                    <l>As to forsake the living God, and fall</l>
                    <l>To worship their own work in wood and stone</l>
                    <l>For Gods! Yet him God the Most High vouchsafes</l>
                    <l>To call by vision, from his father’s house,</l>
                    <l>His kindred, and false Gods, into a land</l>
                    <l>Which he will show him; and from him will raise</l>
                    <l>A mighty nation; and upon him shower</l>
                    <l>His benediction so, that in his seed</l>
                    <l>All nations shall be blest: he straight obeys;</l>
                    <l>Not knowing to what land, yet firm believes:</l>
                    <l>I see him, but thou canst not, with what faith</l>
                    <l>He leaves his Gods, his friends, and native soil,</l>
                    <l>Ur of Chaldaea, passing now the ford</l>
                    <l>To Haran; after him a cumbrous train</l>
                    <l>Of herds and flocks, and numerous servitude;</l>
                    <l>Not wandering poor, but trusting all his wealth</l>
                    <l>With God, who called him, in a land unknown.</l>
                    <l>Canaan he now attains; I see his tents</l>
                    <l>Pitched about Sechem, and the neighbouring plain</l>
                    <l>Of Moreh; there by promise he receives</l>
                    <l>Gift to his progeny of all that land,</l>
                    <l>From Hameth northward to the Desart south;</l>
                    <l>(Things by their names I call, though yet unnamed;)</l>
                    <l>From Hermon east to the great western Sea;</l>
                    <l>Mount Hermon, yonder sea; each place behold</l>
                    <l>In prospect, as I point them; on the shore</l>
                    <l>Mount Carmel; here, the double-founted stream,</l>
                    <l>Jordan, true limit eastward; but his sons</l>
                    <l>Shall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of hills.</l>
                    <l>This ponder, that all nations of the earth</l>
                    <l>Shall in his seed be blessed: By that seed</l>
                    <l>Is meant thy great Deliverer, who shall bruise</l>
                    <l>The Serpent’s head; whereof to thee anon</l>
                    <l>Plainlier shall be revealed. This patriarch blest,</l>
                    <l>Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call,</l>
                    <l>A son, and of his son a grand-child, leaves;</l>
                    <l>Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown:</l>
                    <l>The grandchild, with twelve sons increased, departs</l>
                    <l>From Canaan to a land hereafter called</l>
                    <l>Egypt, divided by the river Nile</l>
                    <l>See where it flows, disgorging at seven mouths</l>
                    <l>Into the sea. To sojourn in that land</l>
                    <l>He comes, invited by a younger son</l>
                    <l>In time of dearth, a son whose worthy deeds</l>
                    <l>Raise him to be the second in that realm</l>
                    <l>Of Pharaoh. There he dies, and leaves his race</l>
                    <l>Growing into a nation, and now grown</l>
                    <l>Suspected to a sequent king, who seeks</l>
                    <l>To stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests</l>
                    <l>Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves</l>
                    <l>Inhospitably, and kills their infant males:</l>
                    <l>Till by two brethren (these two brethren call</l>
                    <l>Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claim</l>
                    <l>His people from enthralment, they return,</l>
                    <l>With glory and spoil, back to their promised land.</l>
                    <l>But first, the lawless tyrant, who denies</l>
                    <l>To know their God, or message to regard,</l>
                    <l>Must be compelled by signs and judgements dire;</l>
                    <l>To blood unshed the rivers must be turned;</l>
                    <l>Frogs, lice, and flies, must all his palace fill</l>
                    <l>With loathed intrusion, and fill all the land;</l>
                    <l>His cattle must of rot and murren die;</l>
                    <l>Botches and blains must all his flesh emboss,</l>
                    <l>And all his people; thunder mixed with hail,</l>
                    <l>Hail mixed with fire, must rend the Egyptians sky,</l>
                    <l>And wheel on the earth, devouring where it rolls;</l>
                    <l>What it devours not, herb, or fruit, or grain,</l>
                    <l>A darksome cloud of locusts swarming down</l>
                    <l>Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green;</l>
                    <l>Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,</l>
                    <l>Palpable darkness, and blot out three days;</l>
                    <l>Last, with one midnight stroke, all the first-born</l>
                    <l>Of Egypt must lie dead. Thus with ten wounds</l>
                    <l>The river-dragon tamed at length submits</l>
                    <l>To let his sojourners depart, and oft</l>
                    <l>Humbles his stubborn heart; but still, as ice</l>
                    <l>More hardened after thaw; till, in his rage</l>
                    <l>Pursuing whom he late dismissed, the sea</l>
                    <l>Swallows him with his host; but them lets pass,</l>
                    <l>As on dry land, between two crystal walls;</l>
                    <l>Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand</l>
                    <l>Divided, till his rescued gain their shore:</l>
                    <l>Such wondrous power God to his saint will lend,</l>
                    <l>Though present in his Angel; who shall go</l>
                    <l>Before them in a cloud, and pillar of fire;</l>
                    <l>By day a cloud, by night a pillar of fire;</l>
                    <l>To guide them in their journey, and remove</l>
                    <l>Behind them, while the obdurate king pursues:</l>
                    <l>All night he will pursue; but his approach</l>
                    <l>Darkness defends between till morning watch;</l>
                    <l>Then through the fiery pillar, and the cloud,</l>
                    <l>God looking forth will trouble all his host,</l>
                    <l>And craze their chariot-wheels: when by command</l>
                    <l>Moses once more his potent rod extends</l>
                    <l>Over the sea; the sea his rod obeys;</l>
                    <l>On their embattled ranks the waves return,</l>
                    <l>And overwhelm their war: The race elect</l>
                    <l>Safe toward Canaan from the shore advance</l>
                    <l>Through the wild Desart, not the readiest way;</l>
                    <l>Lest, entering on the Canaanite alarmed,</l>
                    <l>War terrify them inexpert, and fear</l>
                    <l>Return them back to Egypt, choosing rather</l>
                    <l>Inglorious life with servitude; for life</l>
                    <l>To noble and ignoble is more sweet</l>
                    <l>Untrained in arms, where rashness leads not on.</l>
                    <l>This also shall they gain by their delay</l>
                    <l>In the wide wilderness; there they shall found</l>
                    <l>Their government, and their great senate choose</l>
                    <l>Through the twelve tribes, to rule by laws ordained:</l>
                    <l>God from the mount of Sinai, whose gray top</l>
                    <l>Shall tremble, he descending, will himself</l>
                    <l>In thunder, lightning, and loud trumpets’ sound,</l>
                    <l>Ordain them laws; part, such as appertain</l>
                    <l>To civil justice; part, religious rites</l>
                    <l>Of sacrifice; informing them, by types</l>
                    <l>And shadows, of that destined Seed to bruise</l>
                    <l>The Serpent, by what means he shall achieve</l>
                    <l>Mankind’s deliverance. But the voice of God</l>
                    <l>To mortal ear is dreadful: They beseech</l>
                    <l>That Moses might report to them his will,</l>
                    <l>And terrour cease; he grants what they besought,</l>
                    <l>Instructed that to God is no access</l>
                    <l>Without Mediator, whose high office now</l>
                    <l>Moses in figure bears; to introduce</l>
                    <l>One greater, of whose day he shall foretel,</l>
                    <l>And all the Prophets in their age the times</l>
                    <l>Of great Messiah shall sing. Thus, laws and rites</l>
                    <l>Established, such delight hath God in Men</l>
                    <l>Obedient to his will, that he vouchsafes</l>
                    <l>Among them to set up his tabernacle;</l>
                    <l>The Holy One with mortal Men to dwell:</l>
                    <l>By his prescript a sanctuary is framed</l>
                    <l>Of cedar, overlaid with gold; therein</l>
                    <l>An ark, and in the ark his testimony,</l>
                    <l>The records of his covenant; over these</l>
                    <l>A mercy-seat of gold, between the wings</l>
                    <l>Of two bright Cherubim; before him burn</l>
                    <l>Seven lamps as in a zodiack representing</l>
                    <l>The heavenly fires; over the tent a cloud</l>
                    <l>Shall rest by day, a fiery gleam by night;</l>
                    <l>Save when they journey, and at length they come,</l>
                    <l>Conducted by his Angel, to the land</l>
                    <l>Promised to Abraham and his seed:—The rest</l>
                    <l>Were long to tell; how many battles fought</l>
                    <l>How many kings destroyed; and kingdoms won;</l>
                    <l>Or how the sun shall in mid Heaven stand still</l>
                    <l>A day entire, and night’s due course adjourn,</l>
                    <l>Man’s voice commanding, “Sun, in Gibeon stand,</l>
                    <l>And thou moon in the vale of Aialon,</l>
                    <l>Till Israel overcome!” so call the third</l>
                    <l>From Abraham, son of Isaac; and from him</l>
                    <l>His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win.</l>
                    <l>Here Adam interposed. O sent from Heaven,</l>
                    <l>Enlightener of my darkness, gracious things</l>
                    <l>Thou hast revealed; those chiefly, which concern</l>
                    <l>Just Abraham and his seed: now first I find</l>
                    <l>Mine eyes true-opening, and my heart much eased;</l>
                    <l>Erewhile perplexed with thoughts, what would become</l>
                    <l>Of me and all mankind: But now I see</l>
                    <l>His day, in whom all nations shall be blest;</l>
                    <l>Favour unmerited by me, who sought</l>
                    <l>Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means.</l>
                    <l>This yet I apprehend not, why to those</l>
                    <l>Among whom God will deign to dwell on earth</l>
                    <l>So many and so various laws are given;</l>
                    <l>So many laws argue so many sins</l>
                    <l>Among them; how can God with such reside?</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Michael. Doubt not but that sin</l>
                    <l>Will reign among them, as of thee begot;</l>
                    <l>And therefore was law given them, to evince</l>
                    <l>Their natural pravity, by stirring up</l>
                    <l>Sin against law to fight: that when they see</l>
                    <l>Law can discover sin, but not remove,</l>
                    <l>Save by those shadowy expiations weak,</l>
                    <l>The blood of bulls and goats, they may conclude</l>
                    <l>Some blood more precious must be paid for Man;</l>
                    <l>Just for unjust; that, in such righteousness</l>
                    <l>To them by faith imputed, they may find</l>
                    <l>Justification towards God, and peace</l>
                    <l>Of conscience; which the law by ceremonies</l>
                    <l>Cannot appease; nor Man the mortal part</l>
                    <l>Perform; and, not performing, cannot live.</l>
                    <l>So law appears imperfect; and but given</l>
                    <l>With purpose to resign them, in full time,</l>
                    <l>Up to a better covenant; disciplined</l>
                    <l>From shadowy types to truth; from flesh to spirit;</l>
                    <l>From imposition of strict laws to free</l>
                    <l>Acceptance of large grace; from servile fear</l>
                    <l>To filial; works of law to works of faith.</l>
                    <l>And therefore shall not Moses, though of God</l>
                    <l>Highly beloved, being but the minister</l>
                    <l>Of law, his people into Canaan lead;</l>
                    <l>But Joshua, whom the Gentiles Jesus call,</l>
                    <l>His name and office bearing, who shall quell</l>
                    <l>The adversary-Serpent, and bring back</l>
                    <l>Through the world’s wilderness long-wandered Man</l>
                    <l>Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.</l>
                    <l>Mean while they, in their earthly Canaan placed,</l>
                    <l>Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins</l>
                    <l>National interrupt their publick peace,</l>
                    <l>Provoking God to raise them enemies;</l>
                    <l>From whom as oft he saves them penitent</l>
                    <l>By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom</l>
                    <l>The second, both for piety renowned</l>
                    <l>And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive</l>
                    <l>Irrevocable, that his regal throne</l>
                    <l>For ever shall endure; the like shall sing</l>
                    <l>All Prophecy, that of the royal stock</l>
                    <l>Of David (so I name this king) shall rise</l>
                    <l>A Son, the Woman’s seed to thee foretold,</l>
                    <l>Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust</l>
                    <l>All nations; and to kings foretold, of kings</l>
                    <l>The last; for of his reign shall be no end.</l>
                    <l>But first, a long succession must ensue;</l>
                    <l>And his next son, for wealth and wisdom famed,</l>
                    <l>The clouded ark of God, till then in tents</l>
                    <l>Wandering, shall in a glorious temple enshrine.</l>
                    <l>Such follow him, as shall be registered</l>
                    <l>Part good, part bad; of bad the longer scroll;</l>
                    <l>Whose foul idolatries, and other faults</l>
                    <l>Heaped to the popular sum, will so incense</l>
                    <l>God, as to leave them, and expose their land,</l>
                    <l>Their city, his temple, and his holy ark,</l>
                    <l>With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey</l>
                    <l>To that proud city, whose high walls thou sawest</l>
                    <l>Left in confusion; Babylon thence called.</l>
                    <l>There in captivity he lets them dwell</l>
                    <l>The space of seventy years; then brings them back,</l>
                    <l>Remembering mercy, and his covenant sworn</l>
                    <l>To David, stablished as the days of Heaven.</l>
                    <l>Returned from Babylon by leave of kings</l>
                    <l>Their lords, whom God disposed, the house of God</l>
                    <l>They first re-edify; and for a while</l>
                    <l>In mean estate live moderate; till, grown</l>
                    <l>In wealth and multitude, factious they grow;</l>
                    <l>But first among the priests dissention springs,</l>
                    <l>Men who attend the altar, and should most</l>
                    <l>Endeavour peace: their strife pollution brings</l>
                    <l>Upon the temple itself: at last they seise</l>
                    <l>The scepter, and regard not David’s sons;</l>
                    <l>Then lose it to a stranger, that the true</l>
                    <l>Anointed King Messiah might be born</l>
                    <l>Barred of his right; yet at his birth a star,</l>
                    <l>Unseen before in Heaven, proclaims him come;</l>
                    <l>And guides the eastern sages, who inquire</l>
                    <l>His place, to offer incense, myrrh, and gold:</l>
                    <l>His place of birth a solemn Angel tells</l>
                    <l>To simple shepherds, keeping watch by night;</l>
                    <l>They gladly thither haste, and by a quire</l>
                    <l>Of squadroned Angels hear his carol sung.</l>
                    <l>A virgin is his mother, but his sire</l>
                    <l>The power of the Most High: He shall ascend</l>
                    <l>The throne hereditary, and bound his reign</l>
                    <l>With Earth’s wide bounds, his glory with the Heavens.</l>
                    <l>He ceased, discerning Adam with such joy</l>
                    <l>Surcharged, as had like grief been dewed in tears,</l>
                    <l>Without the vent of words; which these he breathed.</l>
                    <l>O prophet of glad tidings, finisher</l>
                    <l>Of utmost hope! now clear I understand</l>
                    <l>What oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain;</l>
                    <l>Why our great Expectation should be called</l>
                    <l>The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, hail,</l>
                    <l>High in the love of Heaven; yet from my loins</l>
                    <l>Thou shalt proceed, and from thy womb the Son</l>
                    <l>Of God Most High: so God with Man unites!</l>
                    <l>Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise</l>
                    <l>Expect with mortal pain: Say where and when</l>
                    <l>Their fight, what stroke shall bruise the victor’s heel.</l>
                    <l>To whom thus Michael. Dream not of their fight,</l>
                    <l>As of a duel, or the local wounds</l>
                    <l>Of head or heel: Not therefore joins the Son</l>
                    <l>Manhood to Godhead, with more strength to foil</l>
                    <l>Thy enemy; nor so is overcome</l>
                    <l>Satan, whose fall from Heaven, a deadlier bruise,</l>
                    <l>Disabled, not to give thee thy death’s wound:</l>
                    <l>Which he, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure,</l>
                    <l>Not by destroying Satan, but his works</l>
                    <l>In thee, and in thy seed: Nor can this be,</l>
                    <l>But by fulfilling that which thou didst want,</l>
                    <l>Obedience to the law of God, imposed</l>
                    <l>On penalty of death, and suffering death;</l>
                    <l>The penalty to thy transgression due,</l>
                    <l>And due to theirs which out of thine will grow:</l>
                    <l>So only can high Justice rest appaid.</l>
                    <l>The law of God exact he shall fulfil</l>
                    <l>Both by obedience and by love, though love</l>
                    <l>Alone fulfil the law; thy punishment</l>
                    <l>He shall endure, by coming in the flesh</l>
                    <l>To a reproachful life, and cursed death;</l>
                    <l>Proclaiming life to all who shall believe</l>
                    <l>In his redemption; and that his obedience,</l>
                    <l>Imputed, becomes theirs by faith; his merits</l>
                    <l>To save them, not their own, though legal, works.</l>
                    <l>For this he shall live hated, be blasphemed,</l>
                    <l>Seised on by force, judged, and to death condemned</l>
                    <l>A shameful and accursed, nailed to the cross</l>
                    <l>By his own nation; slain for bringing life:</l>
                    <l>But to the cross he nails thy enemies,</l>
                    <l>The law that is against thee, and the sins</l>
                    <l>Of all mankind, with him there crucified,</l>
                    <l>Never to hurt them more who rightly trust</l>
                    <l>In this his satisfaction; so he dies,</l>
                    <l>But soon revives; Death over him no power</l>
                    <l>Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light</l>
                    <l>Return, the stars of morn shall see him rise</l>
                    <l>Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,</l>
                    <l>Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,</l>
                    <l>His death for Man, as many as offered life</l>
                    <l>Neglect not, and the benefit embrace</l>
                    <l>By faith not void of works: This God-like act</l>
                    <l>Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldest have died,</l>
                    <l>In sin for ever lost from life; this act</l>
                    <l>Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength,</l>
                    <l>Defeating Sin and Death, his two main arms;</l>
                    <l>And fix far deeper in his head their stings</l>
                    <l>Than temporal death shall bruise the victor’s heel,</l>
                    <l>Or theirs whom he redeems; a death, like sleep,</l>
                    <l>A gentle wafting to immortal life.</l>
                    <l>Nor after resurrection shall he stay</l>
                    <l>Longer on earth, than certain times to appear</l>
                    <l>To his disciples, men who in his life</l>
                    <l>Still followed him; to them shall leave in charge</l>
                    <l>To teach all nations what of him they learned</l>
                    <l>And his salvation; them who shall believe</l>
                    <l>Baptizing in the profluent stream, the sign</l>
                    <l>Of washing them from guilt of sin to life</l>
                    <l>Pure, and in mind prepared, if so befall,</l>
                    <l>For death, like that which the Redeemer died.</l>
                    <l>All nations they shall teach; for, from that day,</l>
                    <l>Not only to the sons of Abraham’s loins</l>
                    <l>Salvation shall be preached, but to the sons</l>
                    <l>Of Abraham’s faith wherever through the world;</l>
                    <l>So in his seed all nations shall be blest.</l>
                    <l>Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend</l>
                    <l>With victory, triumphing through the air</l>
                    <l>Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise</l>
                    <l>The Serpent, prince of air, and drag in chains</l>
                    <l>Through all his realm, and there confounded leave;</l>
                    <l>Then enter into glory, and resume</l>
                    <l>His seat at God’s right hand, exalted high</l>
                    <l>Above all names in Heaven; and thence shall come,</l>
                    <l>When this world’s dissolution shall be ripe,</l>
                    <l>With glory and power to judge both quick and dead;</l>
                    <l>To judge the unfaithful dead, but to reward</l>
                    <l>His faithful, and receive them into bliss,</l>
                    <l>Whether in Heaven or Earth; for then the Earth</l>
                    <l>Shall all be Paradise, far happier place</l>
                    <l>Than this of Eden, and far happier days.</l>
                    <l>So spake the Arch-Angel Michael; then paused,</l>
                    <l>As at the world’s great period; and our sire,</l>
                    <l>Replete with joy and wonder, thus replied.</l>
                    <l>O Goodness infinite, Goodness immense!</l>
                    <l>That all this good of evil shall produce,</l>
                    <l>And evil turn to good; more wonderful</l>
                    <l>Than that which by creation first brought forth</l>
                    <l>Light out of darkness! Full of doubt I stand,</l>
                    <l>Whether I should repent me now of sin</l>
                    <l>By me done, and occasioned; or rejoice</l>
                    <l>Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring;</l>
                    <l>To God more glory, more good-will to Men</l>
                    <l>From God, and over wrath grace shall abound.</l>
                    <l>But say, if our Deliverer up to Heaven</l>
                    <l>Must re-ascend, what will betide the few</l>
                    <l>His faithful, left among the unfaithful herd,</l>
                    <l>The enemies of truth? Who then shall guide</l>
                    <l>His people, who defend? Will they not deal</l>
                    <l>Worse with his followers than with him they dealt?</l>
                    <l>Be sure they will, said the Angel; but from Heaven</l>
                    <l>He to his own a Comforter will send,</l>
                    <l>The promise of the Father, who shall dwell</l>
                    <l>His Spirit within them; and the law of faith,</l>
                    <l>Working through love, upon their hearts shall write,</l>
                    <l>To guide them in all truth; and also arm</l>
                    <l>With spiritual armour, able to resist</l>
                    <l>Satan’s assaults, and quench his fiery darts;</l>
                    <l>What man can do against them, not afraid,</l>
                    <l>Though to the death; against such cruelties</l>
                    <l>With inward consolations recompensed,</l>
                    <l>And oft supported so as shall amaze</l>
                    <l>Their proudest persecutors: For the Spirit,</l>
                    <l>Poured first on his Apostles, whom he sends</l>
                    <l>To evangelize the nations, then on all</l>
                    <l>Baptized, shall them with wonderous gifts endue</l>
                    <l>To speak all tongues, and do all miracles,</l>
                    <l>As did their Lord before them. Thus they win</l>
                    <l>Great numbers of each nation to receive</l>
                    <l>With joy the tidings brought from Heaven: At length</l>
                    <l>Their ministry performed, and race well run,</l>
                    <l>Their doctrine and their story written left,</l>
                    <l>They die; but in their room, as they forewarn,</l>
                    <l>Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous wolves,</l>
                    <l>Who all the sacred mysteries of Heaven</l>
                    <l>To their own vile advantages shall turn</l>
                    <l>Of lucre and ambition; and the truth</l>
                    <l>With superstitions and traditions taint,</l>
                    <l>Left only in those written records pure,</l>
                    <l>Though not but by the Spirit understood.</l>
                    <l>Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,</l>
                    <l>Places, and titles, and with these to join</l>
                    <l>Secular power; though feigning still to act</l>
                    <l>By spiritual, to themselves appropriating</l>
                    <l>The Spirit of God, promised alike and given</l>
                    <l>To all believers; and, from that pretence,</l>
                    <l>Spiritual laws by carnal power shall force</l>
                    <l>On every conscience; laws which none shall find</l>
                    <l>Left them inrolled, or what the Spirit within</l>
                    <l>Shall on the heart engrave. What will they then</l>
                    <l>But force the Spirit of Grace itself, and bind</l>
                    <l>His consort Liberty? what, but unbuild</l>
                    <l>His living temples, built by faith to stand,</l>
                    <l>Their own faith, not another’s? for, on earth,</l>
                    <l>Who against faith and conscience can be heard</l>
                    <l>Infallible? yet many will presume:</l>
                    <l>Whence heavy persecution shall arise</l>
                    <l>On all, who in the worship persevere</l>
                    <l>Of spirit and truth; the rest, far greater part,</l>
                    <l>Will deem in outward rites and specious forms</l>
                    <l>Religion satisfied; Truth shall retire</l>
                    <l>Bestuck with slanderous darts, and works of faith</l>
                    <l>Rarely be found: So shall the world go on,</l>
                    <l>To good malignant, to bad men benign;</l>
                    <l>Under her own weight groaning; till the day</l>
                    <l>Appear of respiration to the just,</l>
                    <l>And vengeance to the wicked, at return</l>
                    <l>Of him so lately promised to thy aid,</l>
                    <l>The Woman’s Seed; obscurely then foretold,</l>
                    <l>Now ampler known thy Saviour and thy Lord;</l>
                    <l>Last, in the clouds, from Heaven to be revealed</l>
                    <l>In glory of the Father, to dissolve</l>
                    <l>Satan with his perverted world; then raise</l>
                    <l>From the conflagrant mass, purged and refined,</l>
                    <l>New Heavens, new Earth, ages of endless date,</l>
                    <l>Founded in righteousness, and peace, and love;</l>
                    <l>To bring forth fruits, joy and eternal bliss.</l>
                    <l>He ended; and thus Adam last replied.</l>
                    <l>How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,</l>
                    <l>Measured this transient world, the race of time,</l>
                    <l>Till time stand fixed! Beyond is all abyss,</l>
                    <l>Eternity, whose end no eye can reach.</l>
                    <l>Greatly-instructed I shall hence depart;</l>
                    <l>Greatly in peace of thought; and have my fill</l>
                    <l>Of knowledge, what this vessel can contain;</l>
                    <l>Beyond which was my folly to aspire.</l>
                    <l>Henceforth I learn, that to obey is best,</l>
                    <l>And love with fear the only God; to walk</l>
                    <l>As in his presence; ever to observe</l>
                    <l>His providence; and on him sole depend,</l>
                    <l>Merciful over all his works, with good</l>
                    <l>Still overcoming evil, and by small</l>
                    <l>Accomplishing great things, by things deemed weak</l>
                    <l>Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise</l>
                    <l>By simply meek: that suffering for truth’s sake</l>
                    <l>Is fortitude to highest victory,</l>
                    <l>And, to the faithful, death the gate of life;</l>
                    <l>Taught this by his example, whom I now</l>
                    <l>Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.</l>
                    <l>To whom thus also the Angel last replied.</l>
                    <l>This having learned, thou hast attained the sum</l>
                    <l>Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the stars</l>
                    <l>Thou knewest by name, and all the ethereal powers,</l>
                    <l>All secrets of the deep, all Nature’s works,</l>
                    <l>Or works of God in Heaven, air, earth, or sea,</l>
                    <l>And all the riches of this world enjoyedst,</l>
                    <l>And all the rule, one empire; only add</l>
                    <l>Deeds to thy knowledge answerable; add faith,</l>
                    <l>Add virtue, patience, temperance; add love,</l>
                    <l>By name to come called charity, the soul</l>
                    <l>Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loth</l>
                    <l>To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess</l>
                    <l>A Paradise within thee, happier far.—</l>
                    <l>Let us descend now therefore from this top</l>
                    <l>Of speculation; for the hour precise</l>
                    <l>Exacts our parting hence; and see the guards,</l>
                    <l>By me encamped on yonder hill, expect</l>
                    <l>Their motion; at whose front a flaming sword,</l>
                    <l>In signal of remove, waves fiercely round:</l>
                    <l>We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;</l>
                    <l>Her also I with gentle dreams have calmed</l>
                    <l>Portending good, and all her spirits composed</l>
                    <l>To meek submission: thou, at season fit,</l>
                    <l>Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard;</l>
                    <l>Chiefly what may concern her faith to know,</l>
                    <l>The great deliverance by her seed to come</l>
                    <l>(For by the Woman’s seed) on all mankind:</l>
                    <l>That ye may live, which will be many days,</l>
                    <l>Both in one faith unanimous, though sad,</l>
                    <l>With cause, for evils past; yet much more cheered</l>
                    <l>With meditation on the happy end.</l>
                    <l>He ended, and they both descend the hill;</l>
                    <l>Descended, Adam to the bower, where Eve</l>
                    <l>Lay sleeping, ran before; but found her waked;</l>
                    <l>And thus with words not sad she him received.</l>
                    <l>Whence thou returnest, and whither wentest, I know;</l>
                    <l>For God is also in sleep; and dreams advise,</l>
                    <l>Which he hath sent propitious, some great good</l>
                    <l>Presaging, since with sorrow and heart’s distress</l>
                    <l>Wearied I fell asleep: But now lead on;</l>
                    <l>In me is no delay; with thee to go,</l>
                    <l>Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,</l>
                    <l>Is to go hence unwilling; thou to me</l>
                    <l>Art all things under Heaven, all places thou,</l>
                    <l>Who for my wilful crime art banished hence.</l>
                    <l>This further consolation yet secure</l>
                    <l>I carry hence; though all by me is lost,</l>
                    <l>Such favour I unworthy am vouchsafed,</l>
                    <l>By me the Promised Seed shall all restore.</l>
                    <l>So spake our mother Eve; and Adam heard</l>
                    <l>Well pleased, but answered not: For now, too nigh</l>
                    <l>The Arch-Angel stood; and, from the other hill</l>
                    <l>To their fixed station, all in bright array</l>
                    <l>The Cherubim descended; on the ground</l>
                    <l>Gliding meteorous, as evening-mist</l>
                    <l>Risen from a river o’er the marish glides,</l>
                    <l>And gathers ground fast at the labourer’s heel</l>
                    <l>Homeward returning. High in front advanced,</l>
                    <l>The brandished sword of God before them blazed,</l>
                    <l>Fierce as a comet; which with torrid heat,</l>
                    <l>And vapour as the Libyan air adust,</l>
                    <l>Began to parch that temperate clime; whereat</l>
                    <l>In either hand the hastening Angel caught</l>
                    <l>Our lingering parents, and to the eastern gate</l>
                    <l>Led them direct, and down the cliff as fast</l>
                    <l>To the subjected plain; then disappeared.</l>
                    <l>They, looking back, all the eastern side beheld</l>
                    <l>Of Paradise, so late their happy seat,</l>
                    <l>Waved over by that flaming brand; the gate</l>
                    <l>With dreadful faces thronged, and fiery arms:</l>
                    <l>Some natural tears they dropt, but wiped them soon;</l>
                    <l>The world was all before them, where to choose</l>
                    <l>Their place of rest, and Providence their guide:</l>
                    <l>They, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow,</l>
                    <l>Through Eden took their solitary way.</l>
